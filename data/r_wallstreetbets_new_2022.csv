6,wallstreetbets,Guilty-Ham,self.wallstreetbets,21,‘Dramatic increase.’ Foreclosure filings are up more than 150%. Here’s what that tells us about the housing market,"The number of foreclosure starts — which is when the first public foreclosure notice happens — is up 219% since the start of the year, according to real estate data analytics firm ATTOM Data Solutions’ midyear 2022 U.S. foreclosure market report. What’s more, the number of properties that had foreclosure filings (this number includes foreclosure starts) is up 153% from the same time period last year. 

Fully 96% of major metro areas saw an annual increase in foreclosure filings, with foreclosure rates highest in Illinois, New Jersey and Ohio. And when it comes to the number of foreclosure starts, California topped the list, followed by Florida, Tennessee, Illinois and Ohio.

“Foreclosure activity across the United States continued its slow, steady climb back to pre-pandemic levels in the first half of 2022,” says Rick Sharga, executive vice president of market intelligence at ATTOM. “While overall foreclosure activity is still running significantly below historic averages, the dramatic increase in foreclosure starts suggests that we may be back to normal levels by sometime in early 2023,” says Sharga. (See the lowest mortgage rates you can get here.)
What does this uptick in foreclosures mean for the housing market?

Foreclosures are shooting up as the various foreclosure moratoriums that kept people in their homes during the worst of the pandemic’s economic disruptions have now ended, explains Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com. That said, they are shooting up from extremely low levels, she adds — noting that even after the sharp increase in foreclosure activity observed in the first half of 2022, we’re still not back to 2019’s low pre-pandemic mid-year total.

“Much like the sharp turnaround in housing inventory that we’ve observed in the number of for-sale homes recently, when the market has tilted in one direction very extremely, we see huge percentage increases when the trends shift back in a different direction, even though in many aspects what we’re witnessing is just a return to something resembling what was once normal,” says Hale.

Indeed, “it’s important to note that many of the foreclosure starts we’re seeing today — in fact, much of the overall foreclosure activity we’re seeing right now is on loans that were either already in foreclosure or were more than 120 days delinquent prior to the pandemic,” says Sharga. Indeed, many of these loans were protected by the foreclosure moratorium put in place by the government during the pandemic — therefore just halting the inevitable by a couple of years. Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate says, “Foreclosure activity is returning to normal levels after being artificially depressed by pandemic-induced payment relief programs and extended foreclosure moratoriums. In a historical context, foreclosures are still very low.”

And while these foreclosure numbers sound dramatic, Holden Lewis, home and mortgage expert at NerdWallet, says it’s not enough to make a dent in the housing market or the overall economy. “Even a healthy housing market has foreclosures, and this pace is nothing to worry about,” says Lewis.
What does this mean for buyers?

While foreclosures remain unfortunate for the owners of those homes, for shoppers who have been frustrated by the lack of homes for sale in their budget, the increase in foreclosures could bring additional options, says Hale. “But much like the increases we see in for-sale housing inventory, it’s just the first step. We would need to see many more months of these increases before home shoppers will feel like they have an abundance of homes to choose from,” says Hale. source without paywall: https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marketwatch.com%2Fpicks%2Fdramatic-increase-foreclosure-filings-are-up-more-than-150-heres-what-that-tells-us-about-the-housing-market-01659181360",0.88,12,0,12,news,2022-11-03T10:01:19Z,ykvrzo,t3

*  The next step might be 50 basis points.
* More hikes are coming.
* The terminal rate is going to be higher.
* Fed is trying to give investors hope by slowing of rate hike pace but not pivoting at the same time.
* It takes 9-12 months for rate hikes to be felt and 12-18 months for the maximum effect. It makes sense to slow down the current pace given we are only eight months past the first rate hike.
* Fed will want slower total and core inflation, pullbacks in house prices and rents, slower wage growth, lower job openings, and likely an increase in the unemployment rate prior to a real pivot.
* Fed is also concerned about the upcoming winter heating season that may cause another spike in energy prices.
* Rate hikes are likely to continue into 2023 in smaller increments.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%. (Stats as of 2022-10-28)",0.75,8,0,8,dd,2022-11-03T04:30:07Z,ykpuun,t3

79,wallstreetbets,0x11C3P,self.wallstreetbets,16,Fed Talk + JPOW opinions,"I closed out my puts today for some modest gains. Listening through the meeting and listening it through it again, I do sense a bit dovishness in his speech. More so than I had originally anticipated looking at the underlying economic data. Caveat to that is it really involves one thing, the rate of increase, not overall Fed Fund rate increase. On the latter, it looks like he's taking that 25 bps and going to push it towards the Feb meeting. I'm overall still bearish for the time being. 

The rate hike that I initially anticipated would be 75 bps for December. It's looking highly more likely that'll it'll be 50 bps. That said, it's looking way more likely that Feb will be 50 bps increase as well in 2023 and will hold it there. That'll push it towards the 4.75%-5% range.

That said, if economic data doesn't improve halfway through this month going past December, I'm thinking they'll keep pushing rates into Q2 2023 most likely in 25 bps range pushing it over the 5% Fed fund rate point. 

Plan your strategies accordingly and expect a bumpy ride. This latest messaging was less clear with mixed economic data coming. 

TL;DR: Swing trade until mid December data. Expect new bottoms to form some time over the next couple months and then hit capitulation in Q1 2023. Will most likely go sideways for most of 2023 with solid recovery going into Q4.",1.0,6,0,6,question,2022-11-03T00:07:26Z,ykj8cn,t3

Powell agreed there wil at some point be a time to slow rate… however, he confirmed that time is not now and it would be pre-mature… The question that will remain now is was this some unbelievably wild over reaction to what JPOW said or did we just witness the top get put in? There is a case to be made for both that’s for sure.

I took the 389C overnight and that was looking rough for a really long time this morning. Thankfully with the rogue pump before FOMC and then the 2pm pump that was expected I exited for a pretty decent win. Not the best exit but when its moving like that it’s the best you can do for sure. 

That pump also allowed me as expected to exit my now 5dte 386C too for almost 20% win.

I did follow my plan of the 234pm calls. I entered and hit 30% profits pretty much instantly… unfortunately that was where the music stopped playing for me. I fully expected based on movement that we were going to see a really big bullish break out on SPY after the 230 presser as historically has happened. However, it dumped pretty much immediately after I entered. I never saw green again and there was no sense to average down or try to do anything silly. 

If you were okay with small profits it did hit, however, if you weren’t fast it turned into a loss.

Someone asked me last night “why don’t you present a bearish case too?” well until today there wasn’t really a reason to present one. What do I mean by that? Well we had been holding this red bull channel for over 3 weeks now. There was little reason to bet against that until we saw like now a breakdown of that support. 

With SPY now breaking through that green channel support of 378.1 and not only that it also rejected the attempted break through of 388.6 resistance I do favor a bearish case now. With the blue resistance line and red bull channel support line there was also a rising wedge formed that has now broken. 

From here we look at our key levels which will be that 378.1 resistance level. If SPY can break back through there and close over that level tomorrow there actually could be a case made that today was some massive over reaction and we are going to see a reversion to mean break to the upside 385 range tomorrow. However, if we back test and reject 378.1 that is even more confirmation of downside to come. 

If you remember since last CPI the media was screaming a fed pivot and a fed slowing of rate hikes. Overall JPOW effectively just said that is NOT happening right now but in the future will happen. With that narrative now squashed where are we going to go next? The next thing on the Agenda is CPI on November 10th which so far we still do not have a consensus on core or CPI yet. However, monthly CPI is consensus of 0.7 which would be a 0.3% rise over previous MoM. I expect that CPI to release soon and I expect that could absolutely move the markets. 

Key support- 374.6 -&gt; 370.5 -&gt; 365

Key resistance- 378.1 -&gt; 379.9 -&gt; 384.1 -&gt; 388.6

Futures does not look any better then SPY and has broken through the red bull channel support also and landed at 3760 support. This will be the next support that bears what to try to take out. Bulls will look to get this back over 3865 by EOW if they want to remain bullish going forward. 

One major bearish thing we can take away here is that this week effectively was a daily 100ema rejection and now huge break down through daily 8 and 20ema. The bearish case is rising in strength. 

Key support- 3705 -&gt; 3675 -&gt; 3585

Key resistance- 3800 -&gt; 3865 -&gt; 3925

Apple actually was the last domino to fall today and even more interestingly about Apple it has officially broken through the bottom from Friday. That huge green day that Apple had on Friday is now completely gone and then some. 

With this bull channel now broken we are looking at downside obviously now too. It is hard to tell in this picture because if I zoomed out too far it would be hard to see the candles but we are actually seeing quite a bit of red. Looking at the daily you can see that 150.6 is the KEY pivot level of bullish vs. bearish and we are seeing a pretty aggressive rejection of the daily 100 and 200ema which I mentioned earlier would take a few trading days to play out. 

Key support- 144.7 -&gt; 141.1 -&gt; 138.2 

Key resistance- 149.2 -&gt; 150.6 -&gt; 153.4 -&gt; 155.4

They really did massacre my girl Tesla today. I was actually impressively bullish on tesla with that closure over key 230 and the candle body over the daily 20ema which fully closing over the daily 8ema. However, we just saw a pretty massive rejection of the daily 20ema today and closure just above key support at 214.9. 

Key support- 214.9 -&gt; 210 -&gt; 205.6

Key resistance- 219.4 -&gt; 225.8 -&gt; 229.9

What would a -2.5% red day on SPY be without the VIX closing barely green at 0.12%... Well I had imagined they were unwinding the VIX for FOMC and especially for CPI next week, however, I would have expected to see a reaction on the VIX especially with this dump. There is clearly still fear and unknown in this market thanks to JPOW today, however, the VIX didn’t really react. Will it react tomorrow? Or is this going to end up being a straight volume dump with VIX once again being detached? 

Daily log- 

Well I am going to start doing these a little differently! I am going to start a 2.5k 10% take profit/ 20% stop loss challenge. So EOD you will see me post my daily log and post results of a 2.55k challenge. I will probably end up making a separate post for the 2.5k challenge also. For me usually my first trade of the day is my best trade so I will utilize my first entry for the trade. I will use the full $2500 per trade (well as close as I can) and I will update this via Excel like my normal port. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1g4jz5ebqlx91.png?width=828&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05a2491de9d015a29655f9088fa96de3697abc0f

I will start the challenge tomorrow just going to move a few things around in my accounts. Now the thing with this is that it is NOT about full porting… that’s absolutely not what im doing this for and $5000 is not a full port for me. What I am doing instead is hoping to show you guys whether its $500, $1000, $2500, $10,000, etc. etc. If you have proper strategy and risk management and take small profits those small profits will add up over time. This is to show you compound growth. Yes one loss of 20% does set you back two 10% wins, but if you continue to trade the $2,500 it adds up and recovers fairly quickly. 

This is not a full port as I said… I will be utilizing $2,500 PER TRADE so as you see above the starting “balance” is $2,500 but that’s not all that is in there. In the future I may do another one of just one trade a day starting with like $5,000 or something in the account and attempt to grow that… the same premise remains though that as long as you maintain a good strategy one loss really only takes 2-3 trades to over come. With premiums being so ridiculous right now it’s a little hard to use less then $2,500 and even some days $2,500 will be a stretch but like I said it will be as close to $2,500 as it can be. 

I will continue to trade normally in my other account doing day traders/ scalps and of course my level to levels.

Not my best day but not my worse day. The important lesson today was no matter how highly probable a trade is… it can ALWAYS go against you and not only that… it is only a high probability trade if we remember to take profits. These trades that are the “big hitters” have to be lotto size and you have to understand that as you see above there is a chance it goes straight to zero.

3,wallstreetbets,Annual_Equipment_370,self.wallstreetbets,46,I'm pivoting,"Wow, I'm just gonna cash out, delete my brokerage app and forget about fucking stocks forever.  
This week I've accurately used my 3 pre-PDT trades to gain $500 and get rid of this status right before today's shitstorm. I was sitting in cash, 25.2k, just waiting for the FOMC, playing chess and thinking that I'm probably done for today unless market chooses a clear direction after the meeting. Then I see a notification on my phone. YOUR POSITION MAY BE LIQUIDATED.   


wat?  


I opened the app and saw that I'm fucking shorting SQQQ at 52.00 and it's 53.50 now. I forgot to cancel one of the stop orders and went short on margin. I freaked out, tried to cancel the trade via app support and set a buy order at 52.11. Eventually the position was closed at this price and I only lost like $50 on that. And a shitload on neurones.  


After I closed the position, I had a chat with my gf about all the situation, we freaked out, but I felt lucky to escape a potential infinite loss.   


So, happy end, huh? I've evaded PDT status by doing two good trades and dodged this short margin position liquidation.  


Well, after some time I saw a bunch of enormous green dicks on SQQQ chart, realised that market has decided to finally dump and I still can join the trend, bought some SQQQ at 56.00, with default stop loss at 55.00 and profit taker at 57.00. Right after my order was filled, the stonk started to tank. I felt stressed af. It was too much for today and just wanted to exit the trade, fuck off and chill till tomorrow. Instead of closing it with minimal loss, I just watched SQQQ dropped to 55, lost $500, received PDT status, then in half an hour SQQQ jumped to 58, and to 59 in another half an hour. So if I haven't initialised the trade, I would've been +$450 today. If I've sold at a $100 loss, I'd still be fine. If I've managed my stop loss according to volatility, I would've been + extra $1k at close.  


Instead, I'm banned from trading for 90 days. I just watch the market rapidly tanking, feel even more FOMO and self-hatred for being stupid enough to do some emotional trades after such a day and risking my 25k PDT limit. I can't deposit extra money to the account, because my Ukrainian bank doesn't allow me to send USD abroad due to war time restrictions.  


I was waiting for this fucking FOMC and upcoming 52w lows during this whole bullshit rally month, hoping to ride the SQQQ till SPY @ 360. Now I'm fucked, my plan is fucked, finances are fucked. Total loss: $5k. Not as devastating as some of you apes have, but painful enough, and I won't be able to manage this loss in the next 90 days, maybe never, I just feel sick from these fucking candles. Maybe I'll just buy virgin IVW in Feb and maybe will be able to cover my losses in 5 years with the help of cOmPoUnD iNtErEsT. If we won't die in fucking great nuclear war recession till then.

# Final Comment

&amp;#x200B;

AMC is a heavily indebted company; the leverage is unsustainable, and the company is struggling to have positive net income. Its Cash Burning Rate is at 2.56, meaning its spending 2.5 times more its cash availability, giving the company a life expectancy of 30 moths with its current cash &amp; cash equivalents. It will need to cash in accounts receivables to extend more its life expectancy.

Income quality dropped drastically since 2018, it means that total earnings do not correspond to the actual cash intake from its operations.

Cash Ration indicate that the company will struggle to pay its current liabilities with its current cash.

Without  a drastic change in its fundamentals, the company is in high risk.

It is advisable to keep an eye on the Company operations and Management Action and evaluate possible adjustments for the final pricing without any changes in trends, the company is destined to die.

And if inflation is high, then do stocks go up? Or it purely depends on how much the company makes?

Can't a stock go up in inflation times and also in ""normal"" times, because companies can extract profit in many ways. In inflation companies get profit because they charge people more, in ""normal"" times companies get profit because more customer on average

I don't understand these things, and where can I learn?

Long term forecast is more pessimistic than previously forecasted. 


IMO they will get interest rates close to core inflation and see how much it slows down inflation. Then they may increase it further for a full on recession to bring prices down by killing the economy. 


If core inflation does start going down through Q4 and early 2023, we will see slower rate increases. If stays high, we're going to 6% very fast.

67,wallstreetbets,predictany007,self.wallstreetbets,12,Fed approves 0.75-point hike to take rates to highest since 2008 and hints at change in policy ahead,"The Federal Reserve on Wednesday approved a fourth consecutive three-quarter point interest rate increase and signaled a potential change in how it will approach monetary policy to bring down inflation.

In a well-telegraphed move that markets had been expecting for weeks, the central bank raised its short-term borrowing rate by 0.75 percentage point to a target range of 3.75%-4%, the highest level since January 2008.

The move continued the most aggressive pace of monetary policy tightening since the early 1980s, the last time inflation ran this high.

Along with anticipating the rate hike, markets also had been looking for language indicating that this could be the last 0.75-point, or 75 basis point, move. Specifically, some Fed officials along with Wall Street economists and strategists in recent weeks had talked of a “step-down” in policy that could see a rate increase of half a point at the December meeting and then a few smaller hikes in 2023.

That language was not overt in the post-meeting statement from the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, though there was a tweak that could point to an adjustment in policy.

This week’s statement expanded on previous language simply declaring that “ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate.“

The new language read: “The Committee anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time.“

The statement reiterated that policy changes “will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.“

Markets will look to Chairman Jerome Powell’s news conference at 2:30 p.m. for more clarity on whether the Fed thinks it can implement less restrictive policy that would include a less dramatic level of rate hikes to achieve its inflation goals.

Along with the tweak in the statement, the FOMC again categorized growth in spending and production as “modest” and noted that “job gains have been robust in recent months” while inflation is “elevated.” The statement also reiterated language that the committee is “highly attentive to inflation risks.“

The rate increase comes as recent inflation readings show prices remain near 40-year highs. A historically tight jobs market in which there are nearly two openings for every unemployed worker is pushing up wages, a trend the Fed is seeking to head off as it tightens money supply.

Concerns are rising that the Fed, in its efforts to bring down the cost of living, also will pull the economy into recession. Powell has said he still sees a path to a “soft landing” in which there is not a severe contraction, but the U.S. economy this year has shown virtually no growth even as the full impact from the rate hikes has yet to kick in.

At the same time, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure showed the cost of living rose 6.2% in September from a year ago – 5.1% even excluding food and energy costs. GDP declined in both the first and second quarters, meeting a common definition of recession, though it rebounded to 2.6% in the third quarter largely because of an unusual rise in exports. At the same time, housing prices have plunged as 30-year mortgage rates have soared past 7% in recent days.

On Wall Street, markets have been rallying in anticipation that the Fed soon might start to ease back as worries grow over the longer-term impact of higher rates.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained more than 13% over the past month, in part because of an earnings season that wasn’t as bad as feared but also amid growing hopes for a recalibration of Fed policy. Treasury yields also have come off their highest levels since the early days of the financial crisis, though they remain elevated. The benchmark 10-year note most recently was around 4.04%.

There is little if any expectation that the rate hikes will halt anytime soon, so the anticipation is just on a slower pace. Futures traders are pricing a near coin-flip chance of a half-point increase in December, against another three-quarter point move.

Current market pricing also indicates the fed funds rate will top out near 5% before the rate hikes cease.

The fed funds rate sets the level that banks charge each other for overnight loans, but spills over into multiple other consumer debt instruments such as adjustable-rate mortgages, auto loans and credit cards.

Listen, Zuck MIGHT be an absolute regard and Meta MIGHT be the downfall of his company, but I hardly believe that’s the case. Take VR-chat for example, I have seen lots of people compare meta with vr-chat pointing out that there already is an existing product that currently, beats meta in regards to graphics and so on. But meta was and isnt meant to be like vr-chat. Vr-chat didnt change gaming or gaming trends in basically any shape or form. We still use our systems and most of us would never switch to vr when we have pc and other standard gaming consoles. So why would meta try to create an already existing product, which has proven to not be very successfull? Well I think the answer is simple, they’re not doing that. The massive spending everyone is constantly reffering to is obviously not spent on the graphics or how it ”looks”, but the engine and the software, that currently (as shown by vr-chat), is very underdeveloped. The product isnt and was never meant to be operational or used right now, but everyone seems to think that because of the massive spending, bad graphics and an unfinished product, meta is DOOMED. I believe that there is profound potential in the metaverse because of the massive spendings, not the other way around. People want groundbreaking technology that potentially could represent reality, but act suprised when it turns out the cost of such a system to be built, is massive. Regarded sheep mindset.

Analysts polled by Capital IQ, on average, had been expecting the oil and natural gas producer to earn $2.13 per share during the three months ended Sept. 30.

Total revenue was $5.43 billion, up from $3.47 billion in the year earlier. The Street was looking for $4.81 billion.

Rates in have to be above the rate of inflation. 

For example, if you get a mortgage at current rates, about 7% and the rate of inflation is at 8.1%, you are borrowing money at a rate that is lower than inflation, which is not considered restrictive, or that it is stiil cheaper to borrow vs the appreciation of a commodity or asset.

The dilemma that jpow faces, is the time lag theory, which states that for each rate hike, it takes at minimum 6 months for for it to effect in the economy. The totality of  the effects of the rate hikes will really not be known until mid 2023. So no one really knows what the actual effects of hikes will do.

1.) Core CPI is still high and inflation seems to be sticky

2.) Unemployment in the U.S. is pretty low

3.) Risk assets have rallied during the last weeks

This three reasons gives the Fed the right to stay hawkish IMO. I think the Dollar will rally at 2:00pm (except the rate hike is only 50bps) and it might be only a bart pattern again, like at the last one in September.

25,wallstreetbets,ismokenct,self.wallstreetbets,73,Why do people buy Apple so much?,"I'm talking about Apple PRODUCTS

&amp;#x200B;

All apple products are pricey things, including the iPhone, mac, iPad and everything.

Yes they are excellent products with absolutely outstanding performances compared to other products out in the market. Still, yet a LOT of people who buy apple products can save a fortune by picking other products other than the standard MacBook or the iPhone. But yet they have so much market monopoly going on all over the world with such products that will normally be considered quite expensive, to the extent this is almost baffling

&amp;#x200B;

Apple grew AGAIN in the latest quarter
(While all the other major companies mostly had an earnings shock) and I personally think this can only be explained by ""People paying for apple products again and again."" If apple was a growing company aspiring to eat up a lot of the marketplace in the future then the reason for their growth would be pretty obvious. But they're not. It's not like they're starting to insert ads within the ios to increase their revenue. Their one and only source of profit is (mostly) their Apple products. Phones, Laptops, and Tablets that are more than outstanding in quality but also have a significantly higher price tag compared to other products.

It's making people buy the same iPhone again and more (well, not the same but you can still work longer with your previous iPhone.). I don't think Apple would be able to grow this much if people only bought a single iPhone to replace their previous iPhone every three years when their iPhone finally dies.  For some reason they're making the same people buy so much apple products again although their extremely high price tag. Something like buying another iPhone in a shorter span. Or buying other Apple products as well after purchasing your iPhone. Adding a new Macbook in your shopping cart although your previous one is still good.

Seems like people LOVE the iPhone. Yes it's a cult, it's almost something like a new religion

&amp;#x200B;

They don't really have a lot of new customers out there to purchase their first iPhone. Yet the company is still GROWING. A LOT

&amp;#x200B;

Is it the marketing? Is it because of product quality?

&amp;#x200B;

How is the company still GROWING?

27,wallstreetbets,predictany007,self.wallstreetbets,16,Amazon has exited the trillion-dollar club. Sell-off pushes market cap below $1 trillion for first time since April 2020," 

* Amazon’s stock closed down Tuesday for a fifth straight day, falling to the lowest since April 2020.
* Last week the company projected sales in the holiday quarter would be far below expectations.
* The stock dropped 5.9% to $96.79.
* Amazon has exited the trillion-dollar club.

Shares of the e-retailer plunged 5.9% on Tuesday, falling for a fifth straight day and closing at their lowest since April 2020. The sell-off has erased almost all of the stock’s pandemic surge.

Investors continued to punish the company for last week’s disappointing fourth-quarter forecast. Amazon said revenue during the holiday quarter would grow 2% to 8% over the year-ago period, far below analysts’ estimates. The cloud division, Amazon Web Services, also reported weaker-than-expected sales.

It’s the first time Amazon’s market cap has been below $1 trillion since April 2020. The stock has plunged 42% in 2022 and is on pace for its worst year since 2008, when it dropped 45%. The only other year that was worse was during the dot-com crash of 2000, when the company lost 80% of its value.

Like the rest of Big Tech, Amazon has struggled this year due to a slumping economy, soaring inflation and rising interest rates. On top of that, Amazon has been forced to scale back after expanding dramatically during the pandemic, now that consumers have returned to stores.

Amazon has been the second-worst performer in the Big Tech group this year, behind Facebook parent Meta, which has plummeted 72%. Meta told investors last week that revenue in the fourth quarter would likely decline for a third straight period.

Captivating **TL;DR** today - **number go up.** Purchases are u**p 345% ($4.9M to $22M)** from the prior week along with sales, which increased +290% ($263M to $1B). The bulk of purchases stems from insiders at Mobileye Global Inc within the IT sector / Electronic Equipment industry. Active insiders and companies are up 18% and 25% respectively from the prior week.

# High-Level Stats:

* Purchases increased from $4.9M to $22M (+345%)
* Sales increased from $263.5M to $1.02B (+290%)
* Transactions increased from 267 to 316 (+18%)
* Companies represented in Form 4s increased from 170 to 200 (+18%)
   * Net buyers increased from 14 to 23 (+64%)
   * Net sellers increased from 156 to 177 (+13%)
* Insiders filing Form 4s increased from 234 to 292 (+25%)
   * Net buyers increased from 25 to 38 (52%)
   * Net sellers increased from 209 to 254 (+22%)

# Transaction Selection

1. **All** **Direct Open Market Transactions** from **October 24th - October 28th.** These are Form 4 filings with a Transaction Code of “P” or “S”. This narrows the scope to trades where insiders are putting their money on the line.
2. Weekly comparisons are to transactions from **October 17th - October 21st.**
3. **No companies without a ticker** (e.g. opportunity/income/mutual funds).

# Further Context

1. Form 4 data is impacted by a concept known as **backfill** which is par for the course with transactional data. The delay between the Filing Date and the Transaction Date is **\*roughly\*** 2 days and your mileage will vary. This means that **more transactions for past dates can arrive in future filings.** That is why looking at larger trends is key.
2. To combat backfill, filings through this Tuesday are included **\*if\*** the transaction date is from the prior week. Otherwise, transactions from this week are excluded.
3. Data is sourced by the algorithms behind [Form Fore](http://formfore.io/)

# Feedback/Updates

* All feedback, **good bad, and ugly** are welcome - aiming to make these as helpful as possible.
* The **public workbook** should be ready for initial release **sometime next week**. Will also share on Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/FormFore) if that is your preferred hub.
* The newsletter is likely a few weeks out and on my radar. I appreciate your patience!

(TRULIEVE, VERANO, GREENTHUMB, CRESCO, CURALEAF) 

Ontario, Canada-based licensed cannabis producer Canopy Growth’s plans to launch Canopy USA to accelerate its acquisitions of three American marijuana companies and remain listed on a major stock exchange might have provided a blueprint for U.S. companies.

American cannabis operators who touch the plant could follow the Canopy road map to uplist from the Canadian Securities Exchange to the Toronto Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq – provided they’re willing to do a major restructuring, experts told MJBizDaily.

The upside to listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), North America’s third-largest exchange, is that it could help cannabis companies attract more institutional investment.

So far, American plant-touching cannabis companies – such as multistate operators – haven’t been able to raise capital on major exchanges because of the federal illegality of cannabis in the U.S., opting instead to list on the Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE) and over-the-counter markets.

And that might still be a problem, at least for the Nasdaq, which expressed objections to Canopy’s plans and could delist the Smiths Falls-based company.

But the TSX has been more receptive, which could provide U.S. plant-touching operators an avenue for uplisting without waiting for the federal government to legalize marijuana or implement other major cannabis reforms.

In an email to MJBizDaily, Catherine Kee, spokesperson at TSX parent TMX Group, confirmed that Canopy worked directly with the exchange and shared its plans in advance of the announcement.

Kee declined to comment on whether U.S. companies could follow.

“We are aware that legislation applicable to the marijuana sector is evolving,” Kee said. “TMX continues to monitor the developments with interest and we remain committed to supporting the enduring success of the cannabis industry.”

In a note, equity analyst Owen Bennett of New York-based investment bank Jefferies Group wrote that the Toronto Stock Exchange’s approval of a Canopy listing could have major implications for U.S. operators through more M&amp;A by Canadian acquirers and/or enabling “U.S. (operators) to adopt the same structure and uplist to the TSX.”

Restructuring ‘gymnastics’
Kelly Fair – a partner with the international law firm Dentons and external counsel to Canopy’s new holding company Canopy USA – told MJBizDaily she’s proud of the creative approach she and the Canopy team have taken to accelerate U.S. market exposure.

Canopy USA will have a ring-fenced structure in which Canopy Growth would hold nonvoting, exchangeable shares in the holding company, segregating those U.S. assets from the rest of the company.


“To the extent that the substructure is embraced by at least the TSX, then that would provide the opportunity to the U.S. (multistate operators to uplist) potentially sooner than a full legalization event – if they wanted to go through the gymnastics to do structuring like this,” Fair said.

Any MSO looking to uplist would have to create a ring-fenced structure between the listed company and the company that’s actually touching the plant or holding the plant-touching entities, she said.

The pros and cons

Matt Karnes, founder of Greenwave Advisors, told MJBizDaily via email that the TSX is more expensive to list on than the CSE, but that it has more liquidity and more stringent listing requirements – which are both more appealing to institutional investors.

He also said Canopy could try to use TSX approval to pressure the Nasdaq to allow U.S. plant-touching businesses to list.

Another hitch, however, is whether Canopy’s auditors will sign off on consolidated financials that include plant-touching operations in the U.S.

“The Big 4 (accounting firms) have not engaged in U.S. cannabis thus far and this could signal a willingness to accept U.S. cannabis clients – a positive for U.S. cannabis as it gives added assurance to institutional investors as to the industry’s legitimacy,” he said.

Whatever happens, Karnes  believes U.S. multistate operators will follow Canopy’s lead, particularly if they don’t want to wait for legislation such as the Safe and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act that could pass during this lame-duck session of Congress.

“I think whatever path Canopy Growth USA takes, the MSOs will follow, and they don’t necessarily have to wait to see what happens with SAFE.”

42,wallstreetbets,Suspicious-Word-9514,self.wallstreetbets,19,"Macroscope | The Fed meeting preview: 4th 75bps rate-hike is on the way, is pivot coming next?","The Fed's two-day November meeting will end on Wednesday, and the market has well expected its fourth consecutive aggressive 75 basis point rate hike, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. The probability of a 75 basis point rate hike has reached as high as 85.5%, which would raise the federal funds rate to a range of 3.75%-4%, the highest level since 2008.

However, given the recent signals released by the Fed to slow down interest rate hikes, the market is likely to be more concerned about further signals from the Fed after the rate meeting on plans for a December rate hike and the direction of monetary policy next year. The Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has been vocal about the need to slow the pace of interest rate hikes at some point since July, and analysts believe he may also reiterate that point at this meeting. Additionally, a report by the ""New Fed Wire"" last week about the possibility of a slowdown in the Fed's aggressive policy in December continued to gather steam, with medium and long-term US bond yields topping out after hitting yearly highs.

Bloomberg economists said what is less certain is how Powell will communicate a potential future downshift in the rate-hike pace -- the degree of conviction, the risks around hike sizing, and implications for the terminal rate. Economists expect Powell to use 50 basis points present a 50-basis-point move as the base case and clarify that a downshift in the pace of rate hikes does not necessarily mean a lower terminal rate.

It is worth noting that the Fed’s November meeting is also just less than a week before the US mid-term elections. Undoubtedly, how to deal with the Republicans on the high-rise inflation and the risk of recession will become a major problem for Biden. And just last week, two Democratic senators urged Powell not to cause unnecessary pain by over-raising interest rates.

It has been said that there are now major divergences within the Fed on monetary policy. For example, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daley thinks the Fed should start discussions on slowing down rate hikes to avoid sending the economy into an ""unforced slump"". But Kansas Fed President Esther George believes that monetary policy needs to move into a restrictive range, and the strength remains to be watched. Given the recent volatility in the financial markets and the time it takes for interest rate hikes to affect the economy, the Fed cannot act too hastily.

There are also a few views that do not favour a pivot. Fed governor Michelle Bowman hopes to look for signs of falling inflation before slowing down the rate hike. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said he hopes to raise the policy rate to a level that would put meaningful downward pressure on inflation.

Therefore, for this meeting, FOMC members are expected to engage in a heated debate on how to steer interest rates to avoid a troubled economy.

“They may want to go slower just in the interest of financial stability,” said Julia Coronado, the founder of MacroPolicy Perspectives LLC. “It’s a challenge for messaging because they don’t want to ease financial conditions significantly. They need tight financial conditions to keep cooling the economy off. So he (Powell) doesn’t want to sound dovish, but he may want to go slower.”

Some institutions took a relatively cautious view. Nomura believes that the FOMC does not yet seem to have a consensus on the preferred size of a December rate hike, which will limit Powell's ability to provide guidance. The Fed chairman will reiterate that future policy will depend on economic data, including the two non-farm payrolls reports and, most importantly, the latest inflation data. Barclays also released a report saying that the Fed may leave its December policy options open, pending more information on inflation and tightening risks.

The [J.P. Morgan](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NYSE-JPM/) team, on the other hand, made relatively “accurate “predictions on the outcome of this meeting. Analysts believe the most likely scenario going to happen is a 75 basis point rate hike and a hawkish press release, which could allow Powell to retain selectivity for December and next year meetings, while highlighting the current risks of higher inflation. In this scenario, S&amp;P 500 may float between down 1% to up 0.5%. And if the Fed provides clear guidance for the December meeting, this is likely to be seen as dovish and S&amp;P 500 could rise by 2.5%-3%.

In addition, former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers also tweeted recently, saying that the “growing chorus” for the Fed to pause interest rate hikes very soon is “badly misguided.” In his view, the Fed should stick to its current course and not pause too soon, especially given that it has a history of “past errors”.

Aside from rate hikes, let's not forget the glooming recession hanging over the US. Concerns were fuelled last week by the inversion in the 3-month/10-year US bond yields. Prior to this, the 2/10-year US bond inversion had been going on for almost five months. Given the historically extremely high success rate of both yield curves in predicting crisis, there is growing concern about how the Federal Reserve will respond to outside concerns about the economy.

Notably, Jerome Powell had said in the press conference after the September meeting that the goal of fighting inflation had not changed and would be maintained until the task completed, and the federal funds rate would need to be kept at a restrictive level for a certain time. But the FOMC had already revised down the US economic growth rate to 0.2% this year.

It is worth noting that while consumers, the engine of the US economy, are still maintaining spending in the face of inflationary pressures, danger signals are beginning to reveal. The US Department of Commerce said last week that consumer spending growth slowed to a near two-year low of 1.4% from 2.0% in the previous quarter, and consumer purchasing power continues to retreat at a 3% rate and US families are gradually running out of federal financial subsidies in the COVID pandemic.",0.75,10,0,10,question,2022-11-02T14:27:47Z,yk3wmu,t3

Camerco claims:

Uranium inventories are low

Secondary supply is low

Nobody has been investing in supply

‘never started a cycle with this high of a uranium price’

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Camerco appears to be a good steward of capital and understands the market dynamics involved with being a supplier of a not-so-rare mineral

Camerco had \~10% of world uranium production in 2021

China adding \~150 nuclear power plants by 2035

China’s nuclear power generation in the past 10 years has been so great - that it has made up for Europe’s staunch stance on decommissioning - leading to the largest nuclear power plant power generation of all time in 2021. It is conceivable that the west is beginning to realize their mistake and are beginning the process of fixing it, out of necessity from Russia’s and Saudi Arabia’s oil cartel.

Yes, oil manufacturing is going to spike. Oil supply will eventually outpace demand, the Russian war will end, and energy prices will stabilize…but with China investing so much into low-cost energy, will the west want to remain dependent on Russia for economic stability?

Even the most anti-nuclear governments are temporarily halting their decision to decommission 30 year old plants

200 - 400 nuclear power plants to be decommissioned by 2040

Camerco recently announced a deal to buy Westinghouse..

…and Poland just announced they’re building their first nuclear power plant and chose the U.S. and Westinghouse to build their first Nuclear Power Plant.

According to [World-nuclear.org](https://World-nuclear.org): 

About 90 power reactors with a total gross capacity of about 90,000 MWe are on order or planned, and over 300 more are proposed. Most reactors currently planned are in Asia, with fast-growing economies and rapidly-rising electricity demand.

&amp;#x200B;

Major uranium miners are seeing a demand increase in Uranium out to 2024 - and are subsequently significantly increasing production, including Camerco

Many western governments have started initiatives to support nuclear initiatives

Last quarter financial results showed negative earnings because they wrote off the expanse of restarting a mine. They previously shut the mine off due to poor uranium market performance.

Their main competitor is also increasing uranium production. They are both doing so based on contracts they’ve obtained and plan to obtain - neither seem to participate in the spot market in a material way.

&amp;#x200B;

Technically speaking, $CCJ has begun trying to break out of a major downtrend going back to 2014.

$CCJ Reiterated multiple times that they see strong profit going forward, and see production along with spot rates increasing. Given this, the Russian - Saudi oil regime, China's emergence as the nuclear energy super power, a massive reversal in short-term power plant decomissioning, the global incentive to go nuclear (Low long term cost, removal of complete reliance on oil, 'going green'), and  the material fact that Western governments have begun to spend money supporting this thesis...

&amp;#x200B;

Do you guys have any thoughts?

&amp;#x200B;

I'll leave with a headline I found:

Article dated: 6 Oct 2022

# No nuclear power ‘renaissance’ as Europe wrestles energy crisis

""...But after eight months of fighting in Ukraine, and an energy crisis compounded most recently by the alleged sabotage of the arterial Nord Stream 1 and 2 Russia-to-Europe pipelines in the Baltic Sea, European governments long opposed to nuclear power have shown only incremental shifts in their attitudes, which have been informed by years of concerns about nuclear waste and safety.

&amp;#x200B;

A wider pivot has remained absent.

&amp;#x200B;

“We’re not talking about a nuclear renaissance, as such,” Nicolas Berghmans, an energy and climate expert at the France-based Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations (IDDRI), told Al Jazeera, “but maybe more of a change of tide.”

&amp;#x200B;

“A real nuclear renaissance would be if Europe decides to invest in more nuclear power plants.”""",0.7,5,0,5,dd,2022-11-02T10:50:05Z,yjzuta,t3

So ideally fresh minted money is distributed in the real economy and moves up and trickles down and so forth. As you can see in the chart above, money hasn't been moving as much in the economy since the peak in 2000; It's in constant decline with a hard fall in 2020.

Today central banks are trying to battle inflation. As you can see in the chart above, money isn't moving as much, so it's not that there is too much money in the real economy. Whatever they printed in the last 2 years went up to the big black void of finance. All the derivatives market, swaps, trenches and all sorts of made up bullshit has sucked up money faster than your wife sucking her boyfriend's cock.

Inflation is a product of price gauging and artificial crises, such as cutting down oil production, slowing down logistics around the globe, lagging or harsh response to the pandemic by governments etc.

What you're seeing with the interest rate increases will only hit small businesses and working people. Casino always wins. Banks will own everything. You will own nothing at the end of this.

In the next two years, you will lose your jobs, you will lose your homes if you have debt. You will start selling your assets until capitalism owns your ass. We had reached a point of multi-generational wealth with too many high net worth individuals. Those who are pulling the strings are actively sabotaging the economy and are robbing you.

The interest rates will once again go down, when most people lose everything and you can't borrow anymore. This isn't about bringing the inflation down by decreasing money spent in real economy. The chart in the link clearly shows you that there is no increased activity which would increase velocity of money.

So tomorrow or in the next year don't get your hopes up too much. Your average working class ape is in more debt than before and savings are at an all time low. The latest surge in house prices also guaranteed that banks and through them the central banks owns you.

This is the final stage of capitalism. Good luck to you all.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%. (Stats as of 2022-10-28)",0.8,12,0,12,dd,2022-11-02T03:10:54Z,yjr9oh,t3

So you like to make money fast? Is your motto Lambo or food stamps? This it’s for you. At 2 PM ET FOMC announcement made. A large price movement occurs at this time , this movement creates a fair gap value , as Powell starts to speak at 2:30 ET a counter move starts to test price movement created at release of hike announcement occurs. This can easily 2x-4x your 0 dte SPY option if it goes well if it doesn’t you lose 100% of your initial gamble I mean investment. This same pattern has occurred for the last two years . It doesn’t guarantee that it will happen again. Risky scalp with large potential for profit/losses. Just to reiterate if price has a large move up at 2 pm ET than just before 2:30 ET buy puts, if price has a large move down at 2 pm ET than just before 2:30 ET buy calls . This strategy has become rather popular in discord channels/twitter. No positions at the moment as strategy needs to be executed at FOMC.",0.67,3,0,3,dd,2022-11-02T01:46:07Z,yjpc8o,t3

The interesting thing about today is that VOLD (volume) actually came in bullish at open and through the whole day pretty much until right before power hour VOLD was actually in extreme bull momentum. Now SPY could not break out and break away from 385 level. The thoughts are we either watched markets be held up by volume or there was just some weird stuff going on today. There was some dark pool prints hitting the tapes again today. 

The other interesting thing that I noted today is that this is the first time that the day before FOMC the VIX has been red (and especially didn’t spike) since the June FOMCs. The last two FOMCs were the first with a spike of the VIX the day before. 

What does that mean ? well im not quite sure but those months of FOMC were more bullish.

We also have quite a few articles released today saying that Biden supports a pivot of the fed (this was later slightly walked back though). 

My initial thoughts on what to expect tomorrow is that JPOW drops a 75bps (I would be SHOCKED to see a 50bps) but then he should hint at a “we will remain data dependent but there is a case to slow hikes if we continue to see optimism and to fully evaluate the effects of rate hikes.” 

But tomorrow will be interesting to say the least!

This TA is going to be pretty brief as markets gonna move however the algos want it to with FOMC. 

But overall we did attempt to breakout over 390.1 resistance of the green channel. With that pretty stout rejection we are not finding support which we did find almost all day at 385. This could if we get a green day tomorrow also be seen as a nice daily 8ema/ 50ema support test. In addition I am seeing that the 8ema is crossing back over the 50ema (bullishly) for the first time in two months. 

The rejection at 390.1 also was a rejection of the daily 100ema which im not super surprised by as this level is usually a bigger fight. Markets will need the push from good FOMC news tomorrow to break through these key levels and breakout until CPI. 

Key support- 380.1 -&gt; 377.8 -&gt; 374.1

Key resistance- 388.6 -&gt; 390.1 -&gt; 393 -&gt; 397.8 (my potential target for a bullish FOMC)

Looking at futures we have actually had this pattern play out just last week where we found support and managed to push up for an extreme green day. 

With a rejection of that 200ema today and that 3925 level that will remain key resistance and we will look for that level to be closed over tomorrow to continue to be bullish. 

Key support- 3845 -&gt; 3800

Key resistance- 3885 -&gt; 3925 -&gt; 3975

Apple has nearly retraced all the way back to where it was Friday before that massive rip on earnings. I wish I woulda been smart enough to short it Friday at market close. Apple was able to back test and hold the daily 8/50ema support lines today, however fell and closed under the 100/200ema. 

Key support- 148 -&gt; 146

Key resistance- 153.4 -&gt; 155.7 -&gt; 157.4

Tesla actually had a pretty nice pop today and broke through (but failed to close over) a key level. I was mentioning as you can see that 205 to 230 red channel on tesla. With this break through I am actually looking at an upside move on tesla (despite FOMC). 

This is its first time its broken through key 230 resistance since October 7th. We still have not closed over 230 though but as long as tesla holds over its daily 8ema and continues to hold this red bull channel I will remain bullish on it. 

Key support- 230 -&gt; 224.8 -&gt; 219.2

Key resistance- 234.2 -&gt; 239.6

As I had mentioned this is the first FOMC since June that the VIX has not popped significantly the day before. To me this means markets are bullish. I think that anything super hawkish for the FOMC tomorrow especially if he says 75bps in December the VIX is going to spike like no other and we could very well end up with a huge red day. However, I remain bullish and I think JPOW wont say anything to tip the markets down tomorrow. 

10% challenge-

Overall today was yet again another untradeable day after the first big move. Was able to get some nice scalps in today. And with an average down on my SPY and Tesla puts this morning at open I was able to close the SPY level to level puts for green and close the Tesla level to level puts for a smaller loss (they were very red at open). I don’t like DCAing to win a play like that but I didn’t expect that massive pre-market and with SPY holding under and beginning to dump off the key 390.1 resistance at open I felt confident in the DCA.

TLDR for my fellow apes:

\- A scientist started mapping multiple countries' claimed economic growth numbers to the increase in city lights seen from satellites

\- He found a high correlation between the two in democratic countries that had a free press and independent parties measuring the numbers

\- He found a large discrepancy between the two in autocratic regimes that controlled the reporting agencies and the press (shocker!)

\- Tested his theory against reasons why totalitarian countries might have fewer lights when experiencing massive economic growth (hey! they like working and living in the dark! They're allergic to electricity! They care more about the environment!). Nothing seemed to stand up to scrutiny.

\- Based on the growth in lights, he estimates that China's growth was less than half what they claimed. This means that China's GDP is likely less than half of the US rather than nearly equal

\- The other side of the coin is that their total debt levels might be between 600-700% of GDP rather than 300%

\- Paper has been peer-reviewed and presented at multiple economic conferences

I know it's pretty mind-blowing to think China might actually lie about something like this given their honest and transparent dealings to date but you have to admit the science is pretty spiffy.",0.87,397,0,397,news,2022-11-01T22:09:25Z,yjjsm5,t3

TLDR- we could go higher but we have more uncertainty in the near future as opposed to the last 2 weeks.

Some important dates to keep in mind:

Nov. 2nd- FOMC day

Nov. 10th- Oct. CPI data

Cant post the chart cus VisualMod keeps on taking it down.

Simple as seeing the last bear market rally and then applying it to now. We saw a rising wedge form on the monthly chart which is happening now. If the fed says it will indeed be ""kinder and gentler"" in any way shape or form you better bet your bottom dollar we will go to 408. However, on the off chance, the Fed says it will continue to bring more pain all your calls will be worthless in a few days. Now keep in mind that Oct. CPI will also determine if we continue to keep going higher even after a Fed ""pivot"". If CPI comes in hot we could see a similar drop back down to 350.

My plan- Wait till FOMC to see if the fed is indeed going to be kinder and gentler. If so buy $400 calls then take out my initial before CPI and if CPI is hot buy $360 puts.",0.64,7,0,7,dd,2022-11-01T21:44:03Z,yjj173,t3

**price\_efficiency:** how much are you losing to the bid/ask spread? Higher number the better. 

**expected\_move:** this is a percentage of the expected move, as priced by the ATM calls and puts, for this stock by expiration date (this Friday)

How to use this in your trading? 

Do you think **DASH** will move more than 14% by Friday? If not, sell options. If you think it will move for than that, I guess you might want to go long (debit) an option (not recommended). 

Do you want to trade **INTC**? Notice how the put\_IV is double that of calls. That means traders are bidding up the puts, and bidding down the calls relative to each other. If you think its going up, sell those puts and buy the calls. 

Want to trade **SBUX**? Realize that you will lose roughly 2% immediately when filling your trade and another 2% immediately when you exit. This is how the bid/ask spread works.

* The comments do not necessarily signal any pending actions against TikTok.
* The Treasury and Justice Departments are the ones leading a review and negotiations with the company.

Shares of U.S. social media companies Snap and Meta spiked on the news that a Federal Communications Commissioner said the U.S. government should ban TikTok.

“I don’t believe there is a path forward for anything other than a ban,” Republican Commissioner Brendan Carr told Axios in an interview.

Snap shares were up 6% and Meta shares were up 4% Tuesday afternoon.

The comments from Carr, one of four current commissioners at the Democrat-led agency, do not necessarily signal any pending actions against TikTok.

The Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS) in the Treasury Department is reviewing the company’s potential national security implications, given its ownership by a Chinese company, ByteDance. And the Department of Justice is the one leading negotiations over a security deal, The New York Times reported in September.

Concerns over TikTok’s potential security risks are generally bipartisan. Both the Trump and Biden administrations have expressed concerns and reviewed the company’s relationship with its Chinese owner. TikTok has maintained that it stores U.S. user data outside of China so that it would not have to turn over that information to the government, but U.S. officials have maintained their skepticism.

“Commissioner Carr has no role in the confidential discussions with the U.S. government related to TikTok and appears to be expressing views independent of his role as an FCC commissioner,” a TikTok spokesperson said a statement.

For those non-gamers out there Turtle Beach is like the HTC smart phone of the gaming headset/accessory market. It is essentially universally hated. Let's remember consumer spending is down, much larger and more diverse competitors in this space are down, tech companies in general down.

**If LOGITECH is hurting TURTLE BEACH is near fatal condition**

This was Logitechs last quarterly report...

Net Income: **-41.13%**

This was Turtle Beach ($HEAR) last quarterly report...

Net Income: **-1,135.79%**

Net Profit Margin: **-2,070.78%**

Top line revenue: **-47.43%**

All this being said you must remember Logitech is a much larger company approx. 80 times the size of Turtle Beach. with a **much greater range of products.**

Sounds like Turtle Beach needs to create a much diverse range of products to compete... Well that's exactly what they have been doing although they didn't realize the recession was just around the corner. They have expanded their product line into smartphone gaming controllers, XLR microphones, and flight simulator controllers. I believe/hope that their upcoming quarterly report on 11/3 after market is abysmal. **Just check out the open interest on $7 11/18 PUTS.**

**TL;DR, $Hear is going to be buried in the sand over an increasingly difficult market to compete in while burning cash desperately trying to stay afloat.**

88,wallstreetbets,predictany007,self.wallstreetbets,37,President Biden to float windfall tax on U.S. energy producers. Do you think it will affect energy stocks?," 

* Shares of refiners, oil producers drop after news report
* AP reported windfall tax is being considered by White House

President Joe Biden will call on Congress to consider tax penalties for oil and gas companies accruing record profits, according to a White House official, amid stubbornly high gasoline prices that are dragging on Democrats’ midterm prospects.

This could include a so-called windfall profit tax -- which Democrats have been proposing for more than a decade without success. The idea has renewed attention among progressives in Congress after gasoline prices spiked to more than $5 a gallon this summer.

Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat and Biden ally who chairs the tax-writing Finance Committee, has floated a proposal that would impose a new federal surtax on oil companies that record a profit margin better than 10%.

The White House official didn’t confirm that Biden would specifically call for the windfall tax after AP reported earlier Monday that he would. Biden will press oil and gas companies to invest their profits in lowering costs for Americans, the official said.

The president is scheduled to deliver remarks Monday afternoon, according to the White House, on “reports over recent days of major oil companies making record-setting profits even as they refuse to help lower prices at the pump for the American people.”

Biden also could reiterate his request for Congress to eliminate a slew of tax incentives enjoyed by the industry, including a deduction of intangible drilling costs, which allows oil and gas companies to immediately deduct some expenses, such as labor, site preparation and repairs.

Administration officials have weighed a number of other steps to encourage oil refiners to keep more gasoline and diesel inside the US, instead of exporting it, as domestic stockpiles shrink ahead of winter. New restrictions on the export of finished fuels, including diesel, could be imposed administratively.

Oil industry trade groups have argued a windfall tax would penalize domestic energy and fuel production right when the US should be encouraging more of both.

“Rather than taking credit for price declines and shifting blame for price increases, the Biden administration should get serious about addressing the supply and demand imbalance that has caused higher gas prices and created long-term energy challenges,” American Petroleum Institute President and Chief Executive Officer Mike Sommers said in a statement.

“Today, the president is proposing to raise taxes on the U.S. natural gas and oil industry that is competing globally to produce the fuels Americans need every single day.”

The S&amp;P 500 Energy Index initially erased a 2% gain after the news broke but partially recovered trading up 0.9% at 2:04 p.m. in New York. Refining stocks led the declines.

The Biden proposal resembles measures that politicians across Europe, and in some other countries such as India, are imposing on companies reaping record profits from fossil fuels and power generation. Mostly, those governments are using cash raised from windfall taxes to help subsidize soaring energy bills for households.

Critics of such plans say they’ll deter companies from making the kind of investments that are crucial for increasing supply, and keeping prices down, in the future -- a charge that may have more traction in the US, which unlike most European countries is itself a major oil and gas producer.

According to the SEC’s order, Compass repeatedly assured investors in 2017 that a technology upgrade at its Goderich mine – the world’s largest underground salt mine which is located near Ontario, Canada, and hailed by the company as its crown jewel – was on track to materially reduce costs and boost its operating results starting in 2018. **Compass’s statements were misleading because they failed to tell investors that costs at the mine were increasing rather than decreasing, which substantially undermined the projected savings.** The SEC also found that Compass misled investors by overstating the amount of salt it was able to produce at Goderich.

The SEC’s order found that Compass violated the antifraud, reporting, and internal controls provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and various related rules.

EQT which was founded in 1888, is one of the oldest stocks. The majority of analysts (77%) are bullish on the energy company, and they expect the stock to rally 56% from there. Analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a report last month that ETO-Top's risk-reward setup was the ""best"" among its peers heading into the winter this year.

As Europe’s gas price skyrocketing for the year and oil price globally has risen substantially this year due to the war in Russia and Ukraine providing tight supply. Europe could be headed for tough winters for the next 10 years and the supply shortages are likely the keep natural gas prices on a volatile upswing. The EQT should be benefited from tight supply and strong demand from Europe.

General Motors was founded in 1908 and has a buy rating from 62.5% of analysts. At the current price, the stock is expected to rise 25.7%. General Motors comfortably beat earnings expectations last week, but revenue was slightly below expectations and it maintained its full-year outlook. Either way, GM reported profits a full 20 percent higher than expected, triggering the rally in GM shares. The stock rose 3.6% on earnings day and is up 6.8% in the three trading days since the results were released.

TDLR: this pump was fueled by Japanese QE, White House is increasing inflation along with Japanese. Fed will be more aggressive to win, we all know the fed don’t lose




so everyone n their mother thinks we’re up because “pivot rumors” reality is when the pivot news dropped, market went green for a few minutes then shat the bed and ran red. then a certain something happened that made us run green and started this rally. It was BOJ interventions. BOJ (bank of Japan) dumped a whopping 40-50 billion dollars that morning so they can save the collapsing yen. Granted they were and partially still in denial about the whole interference as far as I can tell but they do assure y’all that they are “monitoring the markets” and they balance sheet keeps shrinking at a rather rapid pace.

So far off my estimates (too lazy to go pull up balance sheet) but I believe it’s around 200 billion that they have dumped into the markets since “bottom” was in. to put this into perspective, QT is burning slightly under 100bil a month and these guys just wiped out 2 months worth of hard effort and pain that the fed was trying to inflict in around 3 weeks time.

And there’s no sign of them stopping….. 

Their balance sheet is slightly over a trillion so they can keep this going on for a while.


THE CONSPIRACY

This whole operation along with “pivot” rumors are all well too damn coordinated. First off, we won’t see a pivot, CORE cpi was flaming hotter than Japanese pornstars. core PCE while came under estimates; it is still rising and there’s no sign of slowdown. So ask me again, why would they pivot or even hint at a pivot? 
It’s well known the White House has been begging Powell to go easy this meeting because of the election and u bet Powell is not being swayed. If politics were to get involved Powell is a republican and he’s on his last term so if anything he’s delivering more pain. But we all know Powell is here for the American people so I think he’s just gonna do what he had already planned and that is to just do his job and crush inflation. This is his chance to go down in history like Volker did. So I think the White House likley phoned the Japanese and begged them to dump dollars or someshit idk but this was all too well coordinated of a pump. The treasury(White House) is issuing an extra 150bil in debt above estimates. They are all adding to inflation trying to counteract the fed ahead of the elections.


this is why even if Powell had 75bps planned he will be forced to go with 100bps. They can’t increase QT since it’s really very close to max in terms of liquidity drain vs bank reserves. leaving the only option as more aggressive hikes to fight off the democrats and Japanese coordinated attacks against the fed. 


I think even with 100bps it’ll take some time to bleed the Japanese dry if they keep fighting so we can go on for months green if BOJ is willing to drop all 1 trillion that it has but I’m pretty certain they’ll stop once the election ends cuz it is coordinated after all to just spoof the markets for better votes in favor of the democrats",0.76,39,0,39,question,2022-11-01T13:37:05Z,yj6djm,t3

There’s one inflation gauge that bucks the trend

The New York Fed’s often overlooked UIG believes US inflation is past its peak


Whenever there’s an economic consensus on anything, it’s worth considering how it might be wrong. There seems to be general agreement that inflation and rates will be higher for longer, and “team transitory” has been defeated. But what if we are at an inflection point on inflation? This is the question policymakers should be asking. By one key measure, inflation in the US has already peaked. In fact, it peaked in March, the same month that the Federal Reserve began raising the benchmark rate.

The New York Fed’s underlying inflation gauge has largely been ignored for decades. That’s understandable, and not just because of the snoozer of a name. There wasn’t any significant underlying inflation in the years after the global financial crisis. While the Fed and financial markets are fixated on the 2 per cent inflation target, the UIG isn’t primarily a level forecast. Its real value is in predicting inflection points. It correctly anticipated the lasting high inflation we are now observing. And while it’s still high, the UIG is suggesting it will be abating.

The media and the public are obsessed with the consumer price index, while the Fed’s target is based on the personal consumption expenditures index. Both can be “noisy”, since they include the prices of volatile items such as energy and food. But they are not the only price measures. The Atlanta Fed tracks nine other indices(opens a new window) for inflation that aim to strip out noise. They show inflation somewhere between 4.7 and 7.3 per cent in September.

Most of these gauges remove data to try to identify underlying inflation. Core CPI excludes energy and food costs, for example, while trimmed mean and median measures strip out components with the largest changes in prices to smooth out the index. But the risk with these indices is that they can miss large price moves — up or down — that could be a signal of inflation changing direction.

The UIG is constructed differently, removing noise rather than items from the index. The idea is that movements in trend inflation happen alongside related changes in the trends of other economic and financial factors. The index looks at moves in prices, the labour market, financial markets and the real economy every month and checks the historical data going back to 1995 to see if similar moves had previously lasted at least a year. If so, they are included in that month’s UIG and if not, they are filtered out as noise.

You really can’t use the UIG to forecast the level of inflation, as has sometimes been suggested(opens a new window). Where it matters is in showing when the inflation trend is changing, and on this it has a decent track record in both normal and unprecedented times. When CPI hit a peak in 2018, for example, UIG clearly showed the peak while core CPI and trimmed mean and median indices suggested inflation would continue rising. In mid-2009, UIG showed a trough in inflation while the other measures took another year to reach a nadir.
What about during the pandemic? Core CPI did a good job of signalling a bottom for inflation in mid-2020 before rising, but dipped in the third quarter last year, wrongly suggesting that inflation would come down. The trimmed mean and median inflation indices failed to indicate a shift towards higher inflation, showing a trough more than six months after CPI and core CPI.

UIG found a bottom roughly in line with headline CPI and then started a steady climb upwards, rightly ignoring the slump in the third quarter of 2021. Of these metrics, it provided the earliest and most reliable signal for a rise in underlying inflation.

The Fed is now looking for signs that trend inflation has peaked and that monetary tightening is bringing inflation back towards its target. Much to its alarm, core inflation dipped in the second quarter of this year before accelerating in August and September. Median and trimmed mean inflation have been on a steady upward climb, with no signs of stabilisation. But the UIG peaked in March 2022, stabilised at high levels and has been gradually falling since July.

All the different gauges for inflation suggest it is way above the Fed’s target. But we know monetary policy works with long and variable lags, and there is a danger overtightening could spark a recession. The central bank aims to look through transitory factors and set policy based on the underlying trend. The UIG shows the trend is finally starting to reverse course. With rates now restrictive, that suggests it’s time for Fed officials to consider slowing their tightening path.

**1) litgations 2) europe economy**

**European economy and the rise of the germans** 

**The dark winter**
- we all know European is heading into a difficult winter, although energy prices have gone down since i write this, it is no guarantee they will remain so. However, the germans are going to spend there way out of this winter and are poised to avoid a recession in 2023.

*it has already begun*

Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase. 



1) winter recession avoided 

https://m.ca.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/germany-dodges-recession-but-inflation-climbs-to-116-2811016

Why will it benefit the underlying stock? 

Spending - stocks go up in spending times bud. 

2) surprising growth,  will it be enough to outpace inflation ?  For 2023  Germany is likely to be okay, and Bayers product are essentials, during hard times Bayer makes money as well.

https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/short_news/germany-under-fire-for-canibalistic-e200-billion-investment/

3) relief plan makes  the EU  worried, if Germany avoid recession by spending, other European nations will want to follow the idea,  inflation cannot be controlled like this. EU therefore sounds the alarm and potential consequences, it is likely that not too many nations will follow suit in my opinion , Germany can afford to be spending, not many  European nations can, making Germany the exception, in fact if Germany being the biggest economy in Europe  makes it through, much of Europe will also make I through. 

The worried citi suggest the following 

*The proposals could cut 2 percentage points off inflation in the next year, according to Citi, but they are unlikely to prevent an economic contraction. The package “may soften the coming recession but also poses risks, in our view,” Citi analysts said in a note released last Friday.*

Why are we using words like economic contraction  all of a sudden instead of recession?

- **The litigations over roundup** and *glysophate*


 Bayer is still facing litigations due to the acquisition of Monsanto and RoundUp and during the last earnings call, Werner Baumann gave updated numbers. There are about 141,000 claims in total and about 108,000 have been settled.

Remember they have already set the cash aside, have won or litigated the majority of all cases. The rest are likely to head the same path.

Here is glysophate  surging 300% in 2021 https://www.agweb.com/news/crops/crop-production/glyphosate-prices-soar-much-300-and-thats-if-you-can-even-get-it

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king: 

Take a look at some of these charts in the past 59 years  have crop production globally  ever decreased over time ? Never, ever.

For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic.

50,wallstreetbets,illikwid,self.wallstreetbets,25,How to trade 0dte options on FOMC Wednesday - A Regard's Perspective,"PHASE 0: 9:30-1:59:59

&amp;#x200B;

trading rangebound af.  0dtes swinging +/-10% on pure delta.  theta is frozen.  buy puts on your preferred index/etf at any time.  depending on your risk tolerance and the underlying, open a limit sell order for 1.5x-3x.  pussy with spy itms? get ur +50%.  lunatic on some otm spx? go for that +200% in 5 minutes u fucking god.

&amp;#x200B;

PHASE 1: 2:00:00-2:05 

 

i dont even wanna talk about what to do if its not 75bps but just in case...

100bps: do some sick euphoric dance and start howling.  then remember u set a limit order and lose your mind as you watch your 1.5x turn into free millionaire tickets.

50bps: cry and hope jpow starts levitating and speaking in tongues.  or maybe ur a maniac with a 4100 spx call hedge in case jpow starts handing out bags of cash instead of having a press conference.

&amp;#x200B;

75bps:

instant sentiment analysis on fomc statement finds ""pivot language"" to be largely absent.  spy down 1% in seconds, maybe making it all the way to -2%. your low-return sell order goes off in 10 seconds.  you clench and maybe walk around in a circle for 5 minutes.  your longer shots sell.

&amp;#x200B;

PHASE 2: 2:05-2:33  

&amp;#x200B;

conflicting narratives enter the picture.  the gamma recedes.  hopefully you're back in cash.  maybe you're in shambles cuz ur greedy limit just had its balls tickled.  we catch our breath and say, 'hold on, lets see what pow pows gonna say.  why are we down?  it was 75bps like everyone predicted.  that was priced in.  that was an overreaction, grab up this discounted shit quick.'  

market churns and claws back some to all of phase 1 losses.  pow pow takes his sweet ass time walking up to the podium and clears his throat...

&amp;#x200B;

PHASE 3: 2:34-2:4X

&amp;#x200B;

i dont know really. probably not much happens.  powell on his prepared remarks.  maybe he throws a hawkish jab or two, or sprinkles some grass for the bulls. hold on to ur cash.

&amp;#x200B;

PHASE 4: 2:4X-EOD

&amp;#x200B;

this is where we set momentum into jobs on friday.  powell opens some q+a.  first q probably some random bullshit that pow pow deflects heroically.  then maybe another softball, maybe a few more.  then some legendary lunatic reporter grabs the mic and says, 'YO JEROME YOU FUCKING PIVOTING OR WHAT?' powell takes a moment to collect himself, then states with volume and conviction we shall not pivot.  

now we're at another crossroads.  i'd say market starts selling right the fuck off.  but maybe, just maybe, we irrational bastards are so impressed by jpows stalwart leadership that we collectively decide an economy helmed by such a man must be infallible and head off towards the moon.

you could be in position before this pivotal (fuck you) line of questioning, hoping to predict the market reaction or do a spread if ur into that shit.  or you could wait a few minutes after jpow drops the mic for the direction to become clear and jump on it.  we're not changing direction til mid thursday at the earliest.  i wouldnt even call you a pussy if you bought a thurs / fri exp instead at this point and sold it late on thurs.  if you go with a 0 day roll that shit sometime 3:30-EOD.  

at least 3 percent up or down close on wed and an additional 1-3% move in the same direction on thursday.  

&amp;#x200B;

thats it.  if you made it this far, congratulations! for even considering trading on this perspective, you are now a more degenerate member of society.  even if we strike it big, we're gonna lose it soon or spend it on food accented with gold flakes, caviar, and our own tears.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%. (Stats as of 2022-10-28)",0.81,17,0,17,dd,2022-11-01T02:09:57Z,yitajz,t3

But cause of all my past losses, I didn’t have the guts to press submit I just didn’t. And guess what, 2000% gains it went up 2000 frickin percent. I can’t believe I had it all was left just submit and at the end of day I could’ve gained 2000%. But I didn’t make it and I got even more scared cause I missed it cause I was scared. 

Anyway, today I was like I am not missing anything cause of fear, and I made two trades, both expired worthless so $600 is gone. 

I am sick of this. And it’s not like I just gamble. I calculate it and go for it, but I feel like the universe against me. Sometimes when I sell to break even it goes up later. And when I am like leave it let’s not just break even it will go up, no it goes down and down.

What a frightfully boring day today was… This honestly was one of the worst choppy range days I have seen in months. The total range for today on SPY was $3.14… usually we see that level of movement on the opening candle of SPY. 

The question remains where are we headed? 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you to u/80hz14 for posting this in the chat today… as you can see we have a few possible scenarios and outcomes for Wednesdays FOMC meeting. Overall I would say I am in the 75bps hike and a dovish presser where jpow hints at a 50bps in December. I think we should see a 3%+ green day on Wednesday. I would be pretty shocked with rising inflation to see JPOW drop a 50bps but honestly it could happen for other reasons. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today we saw an extreme small range day (only 39% of the 10 day average) inside day that closed as a gravestone doji. With 388.6 remaining as resistance I will be looking for downside until SPY can break free and close over that resistance level. Today we did see that the 386/ 3880 level on futures was impressively strong support. Any time SPY came anywhere near that we would see a pretty impressive pop. 

Overnight and tomorrow those will be our clear “breakout/ down” levels. From there it depends on which way markets want take us. We very well could end up with an equally as annoying range day tomorrow. However, I wouldn’t be surprised to see a small pullback tomorrow down to the 380 range. The last few FOMCs the two days leading up to it have provided a small pullback. 

Key support- 385 -&gt; 380.1 -&gt; 378

Key resistance- 388.6 -&gt; 390.2 -&gt; 393

Futures also had an extremely choppy overnight and intraday today. However, its daily char is closing with a double top right at 3910 and just under the daily 100ema resistance of 3925. With holding that key support of 3770 all day today we will look to those two key levels tomorrow to guide us on what direction we are going to be headed tomorrow. 

Its not impossible to believe that markets could rally tomorrow with hopeful whispers of FOMC on Wednesday but the historical trend would point to slight downside (risk off) leading into FOMC.

Key support- 3870 -&gt; 3845 -&gt; 3800

Key resistance- 3925 -&gt; 3975

Not much of a surprise after that’s unbelievable Friday that Apple had we had a pretty nice pullback on Apple, although it looks more impressive than it actually was being that Apple only closed down 1.54%. 

Apple is at a key level right here fighting between the daily 200ema of 153.4 and the daily 100ema of 152.2. Historically when it comes to Apple interacting with the 200ema it is a fight that lasts for a few trading days as the daily 200ema on Apple is a major major pivot point. I have not seen too many times where it takes a straight trend line down or up over the daily 200ema. 

Key support- 151 -&gt; 148

Key resistance- 153.4 -&gt; 155.8 -&gt; 157.4

&amp;#x200B;

Tesla remains a tricky one to get a good read on, however, as you can see we are maintaining a pretty consistent red sideways consolidation channel from 205 to 230. We have now see our 4th day in a row of Tesla rejecting the daily 20ema and refusing to close over it. However, this is now the 4th day in a row that it has closed over the daily 8ema. As you can see we are in a pretty impressive red bull channel here, however, that blue resistance and red support lines are forming a really nice rising wedge. 

Until Tesla can breakout and most importantly close over the daily 20ema I remain bearish on it. My anticipation would be that we see a move one way or another tomorrow. Key support for that red bull channel is 224.8 tomorrow which is also the 3 day support line and previous resistance line. While its not impossible I would be surprised to see Tesla hold between 230 resistance 224.8 support. 

Key support- 224.8 -&gt; 219.3

Key resistance- 230 -&gt; 234.2

You gotta love the VIX this thing just defies all logic. I am actually surprised with FOMC in two days to see the VIX unwind more like it did today, however, the VIX actually had a really impressive spike at open and closed down with a nice inside day… one of those odd days where the 10year yield, DXY and VIX were all red and SPY was red. 

Some of the issue I saw today was that over all price action, volume and momentum opened pretty bearish this morning, however, the VIX continued to unwind and I believe that led to a lot of this choppy tight range price action. The VIX is currently holding right at the same level it was prior to last FOMC where the day before fomc closed at a VIX of 27.15. 

Overall no real sense of direction for SPY tomorrow as until FOMC happens the market in my opinion is not going to play nicely and not play by the technicals. 

FOMC day is setting up to be a really nice day for some nice wins, I have posted that TA and trade plan/ analysis. Make sure you give it a read! 

10% challenge-

Today was a really tough day for me today. Actual scalp wise I did do fairly well today, however, I had my level to level calls from Friday that I should have closed the Tesla calls green this morning (regrets) and I actually ended up closing them pretty early this morning when pretty much everything pointed to downside… only for them to pop up right after I closed them. If it wasn’t for those two woulda been a decent day despite the hard price action. 

I also thing that’s something that is going to catch this market by surprise here very soon and possibly even tomorrow for pretty much the last week or two now the price action of SPY in the mornings has been pretty bearish and has also been support by volume too. However, by 11ish we have seen a complete snap of trend and 180 reversal… today just chopped instead of broke out. I wonder if we get a slight sell off tomorrow as people get caught thinking its time to buy the morning weakness. 

&amp;#x200B;

Closing out my most profitable month of the year and also one that I do not plan to attempt to beat. Great month with some great plays. Keeping in mind that my average % gain per trade was still only 12.7% for the month. This wasn’t so much about getting random massive winners… though I had some nice wins in there too… it was more about consistent small gains that have added up over time and most importantly limiting downside risk with a -20% stop loss. 

I posted my article about that this weekend but something to keep in mind is that just because I use a -20% stop loss on my scalps doesn’t mean that is right for you. You have to find what works for your strategy and your overall profits/ trade. The whole theory is though that you can have an extremely successful strategy but if one loser wipes out all of your weeks profits or numerous days of profits then you need to manage your risk better. It’s a balancing act of having a lose enough stop to not stop out too quickly (especially on my level to level plays) BUT not having such a big stop loss that it hits and the loss takes numerous trades to overcome.

Mostly for my own records but I am going to starts separating my scalps and my level to level trades from eachother and this month of November I really wanna analyze the comparison of them and everything more closely.

2,wallstreetbets,predictany007,self.wallstreetbets,18,JPMorgan Says Dovish Fed Could Spark The S&amp;P 500 To Rally 10% In One Day.,"While hopes for a less aggressive Federal Reserve helped US stocks overcome last week’s flurry of disappointing earnings from tech giants, JPMorgan Chase &amp;. Co.’s trading desk now sees room for a massive rally should policy makers turn dovish when they announce their decision on Wednesday.

The S&amp;P 500 could surge at least 10% in one day if the central bank raises interest rates by a slower-than-expected half of a percentage point, and Chair Jerome Powell signals willingness at the press conference to tolerate elevated inflation and a tightening labor market, according to the bank’s sales team including Andrew Tyler. The scenario is the “least likely” to materialize, yet the “most bullish” outcome for equity investors, the team wrote in a note to clients on Monday.

Laying out every possible scenario on Fed day, the JPMorgan team is embarking on a high-stakes task of predicting market moves based on an event that has largely been positive for stocks this year. Of the six prior meetings, the S&amp;P 500 rose four times on Fed day and fell on the other two, according to Bloomberg data.

To be sure, the bank’s economists expect the Fed to boost rates by another three-quarters of a percentage point, in line with the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey, and Tyler’s team views other scenarios as less likely. Still, the exercise offers a lens into the risks that investors are grappling with.

“These outcomes are skewed to the upside as our view is that last week the market had every reason to retest lows given the disappointment from megacap tech earnings and still moved higher,” noted Tyler and his colleagues. “Several client conversations have focused on trying to identify who is the incremental seller; we think the risk/reward is to the upside.”

Below are the scenarios from the JPMorgan team on how the S&amp;P 500 could react on Fed day.

* 50 basis point hike, with a dovish press conference: “It is difficult to conceive of a scenario where this outcome occurs given inflation levels and a tight labor market,” the team wrote. “Should this outcome occur, the immediate reaction could produce a double-digit one-day return for equities.” S&amp;P 500 up 10% to 12%
* 50 basis point hike and a hawkish press conference: An outcome that could stem from a Fed that is increasingly concerned about financial stabilities as it balances growth and inflation. S&amp;P 500 up 4% to 5%
* 75 basis point hike and a dovish press conference: A scenario viewed as having the second-highest probability of playing out. “If you saw the Fed give explicit guidance for the December meeting, then that is likely viewed as a dovish outcome.” S&amp;P 500 up 2.5% to 3%
* 75 basis point hike and a hawkish press conference: “This is the most likely outcome with Powell retaining optionality for December and 2023 meetings while emphasizing the current risks to inflation moving higher.” The team also views this as the outcome most expected by bond markets, so says there may not be a significant move in yields that keeps equities from melting down. S&amp;P 500 down 1% to up 0.5%
* 100 basis point hike and a dovish press conference: While this is seen as unlikely as a 50 basis point hike, it may mean the Fed both wants a higher terminal rate and wants to complete the tightening cycle this year. “Separately, the market may digest this move as the Fed having prior knowledge of where next week’s CPI prints.” S&amp;P 500 down 4% to 5%
* 100 basis point hike and a hawkish press conference: Considered the best outcome for equity bears waiting for this latest rally to dissipate. “Here this would seem to be a Fed reassessing its own inflation forecasts, which some investors feel is too optimistic.” S&amp;P falls 6% to 8%, likely resting year-to-date lows.

Why did I come across this, some might ask? 

Well, I was trying to find out when stock market became electronic. Then I was wondering who programmed it.. 

Okay then, why am I curious about who programmed it?

I'm kindly regarded, hugely. But I still wonder things sometimes; If some of you are like me, and have been glued to these charts past 2'ish years - there's a kind of relative thing happening.. I can't quite describe it but as a uh, prolonged barrel-rolling sewing machine pattern, if that makes sense... and it's not 'making' something it's .. well, sort of seeding a landscape we're looking at from top-down..

Which got me to the wondering part, who was it that programmed the NASDAQ initially? 

6oo6ling that specific Q got me nothing so I broke down what I could possibly render a reasonable direction from: computer/software companies in the 60's

A few things stood out to me - IBM, Fortran, and [Harlan Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills) 

IBM because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then. 

"" In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than [4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1946%E2%80%931959:_Postwar_recovery,_rise_of_business_computing,_space_exploration,_the_Cold_War) were IBM machines. ""

&amp;#x200B;

[Fortran](https://emmachev.com/what-is-the-difference-between-pascal-and-fortran-programming-languages/) because it is a procedural, imperative, general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations. After IBM developed it in the 1950s, it soon gained popularity in programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then Harlan Mills. Just look at his timelines and titles. Specifically -  

* Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1975–81

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my thinking.. SEC knew then what we know now. Banks are assholes doing asshole stuff (if you read more of ""A Piece of Paper Revisted"" (see way above). And they figured, well, if we get rid of the human element (to some degree) this might make things more legit for more ppl than less of them. 

IBM is a huge, American computer company. Invest in America, it was the 50's/60's afterall. We were boomin' baby. And they have this Fortran language that handles all kinds of processes. Then we have Harlan Mills - I mean for all what was going on above... he has a suspiciously obvious time gap.. then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth.. pretty sus cuh.

&amp;#x200B;

All right, you've gotten this far in my rabbit hole. 

Along my tinfoil travels, I came across this other dude [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Early_years) \- he apparently influenced Harlan Mills - As an IBM research fellow, Mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development. These included automata theory, the structured programming theory of Edsger Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, and others, and Markov chain-driven software testing.

But what got me in Dijkstra's 'Legacy' section was the [Banker's alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) \- 

The Banker algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an ""s-state"" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

And this is when I came full circle on the part above I was trying to describe at ""I'm kindly regarded."" 

Anyway, this rabbit-hole kinda tripped me out. Figured a share.

I wanted exposure to the instability of the country so I bought puts in an ETF there for after the transition of power in the new year.

A few weeks back, I mentioned the bounce was coming here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading\_spy\_next\_9\_days/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading_spy_next_9_days/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  and here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading\_spy\_week\_of\_oct\_17th/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading_spy_week_of_oct_17th/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  

Lets review the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November. 

What other macro trends do you think I missed?

Voters in five states, including four that are among the most conservative in the country, are deciding on whether to legalize recreational marijuana this election. If passed in each state, Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota would join 19 other states and the District of Columbia where cannabis has already been legalized for personal use.

All except Maryland backed Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, underscoring that the legalization effort increasingly spans the political spectrum and is even gaining support in some of the most overwhelmingly Republican parts of the nation.

A recent poll from Monmouth University shows 68% of the American public supports legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use. The support crosses gender, age, income and education differences, polling shows. In addition to the 19 states that have legalized personal recreational use, 37 states now allow pot for medical purposes.

""The more people learn about cannabis and cannabis policy, the more we see them support making cannabis legal and regulating it and treating it like alcohol,"" says Mason Tvert a partner at the marijuana policy and public affairs firm VS Strategies. ""This is an issue that is broadly supported by Americans of all political stripes, conservatives and progressives,"" he says.

Time to delete the app. It is as worthless as Facebook, excuse me, Meta.","Airbnb, we all know it, we all have used it in the past (when it was cool). But now, if you have traveled any within the last year or two, you know that fees are tearing this company apart. It used to be cheaper to rent an airbnb compared to a hotel for the longest time. No one liked going to hotels and they were actually disrupting the hotel industry. But now, with all of the service fees, and CLEANING fees which are sometimes 100-110% of the nightly rate.

For example, here is a nightly rental in Scottsdale, AZ. For $151 a night, I pay $139 cleaning fee and $41 service fee. So after fees, you are paying effectively a 119% premium on your rental just to stay somewhere other than a hotel. Who would do that? and why? Not to mention you have to clean the place yourself, and basically do the home maker's job, because if you don't your rep gets hit. Its an absolute joke of a company now.

https://preview.redd.it/hd3muojqm6x91.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e59b111482ca40e835e93f16c70bbb87b5866ab2

So then after looking into maybe I am just biased because I hate paying these people to make me clean, I did a simple google trends search. Searches for ""airbnb"" on google actually peaked the first week of this previous quarter in July. And since then have been plummeting to nearly Dec lows. So maybe its inflation, maybe its fees, who knows but this can't be good for bookings.

[YTD chart of \\""airbnb\\"" searches](https://preview.redd.it/4a5ti97kn6x91.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f1e6193e6036377ee98f4b39f041c9eaa642ac1)

But then I do some more searching and I find this. Hosts are obv struggling to get bookings. Maybe its because your fees are insane!

https://preview.redd.it/prndr35wn6x91.png?width=2032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d93c341f44fad279542269b1fd4f172ac39b98ab

So then I started I got my crayola crayons out and started looking at the chart. The chart has been in an obvious downturn since November 2021. We are in a pretty significant downtrend, and have been consolidating since the drop in December. Looking at this chart I would expect this flag we are in currently to snap to the downside and make a new leg down which would put us near $80 a share again. Which I feel is an appropriate value given the environment we are in.

https://preview.redd.it/647nse4dp6x91.png?width=1269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1da4d592f19da06b579ada7ba0e479753a2e0739

Once I put my crayons up, I wanted to check and see what company directors and insiders have been doing with the stock considering we are near all time lows. You would think if the market for bookings and travel was expected to ""pick up"" given countries opening back up (Japan, Canada, etc.) that these insiders would be picking up stock at these cheap prices. Well... was I surprised.  Joseph Gebbia (co founder of Airbnb) was holding 2.75M shares at the beginning of Q3. He has no sold off 1.5M shares since the start of Q3, effectively cutting his position in half. FIFTY percent less than he had at the start. Sounds like someone has a confidence issue in his company's ability to disrupt the hotel industry.

https://preview.redd.it/f02i8nfup6x91.png?width=2778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c7fd40a034d34b56a77c6188dbef9a64349b3a9

Airbnb has been unable to manage fees like they have promised. They promised to ""look into it"". Nothing has changed, inflation has been destroying lower income families preventing people from taking vacations, and when they do, they are forced to go the cheaper hotel route option again. Which at the end of the day, you have less expectations as a guest, no cleaning, and sometimes even free breakfast. I am taking puts for these earnings tomorrow after close.

I am holding $90 P 11/4 and $80 P 11/4. Wish me luck fellow regards. I have convinced myself this is the beginning of the end of Airbnb. Good bye.

Seems there was abysmal quality control and they rushed the launch.

More importantly, there isn't any official news or statement from nvidia yet (as far as I can see, please correct me if I'm wrong). I'm sure some nvidia engineers are shitting their pants right now though.

I own a large number of shares of the world's worst stock. If I were to sell CCs against it, I understand that the premium is instantly available to use to buy whatever. The leaps of this shitty meme stock 2 years out go for a huge premium, which I could use to bring my cost basis down drastically. My question is, say I sell CCs 2 years out, and take the premium to buy even more shares, could I then sell CCs on those new shares purchased, in a sort of endless loop (it would be a bit like an asymptote I imagine), whereby I would eventually nearly double the amount of shares I own?

As far as I know, the downside would be that my max gain is limited to the strike price that I am selling at 2 years out. However, for me, since I am doubling my shares and choosing a strike that is far off the current price, this would be more than worth it and I would sell the moment the stock hits that price anyway.

MSOS,"https://www.marijuanamoment.net/schumer-says-congress-is-very-close-to-passing-marijuana-banking-and-expungements-bill-after-work-with-a-bunch-of-republicans/

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says Congress is getting “very close” to introducing and passing a marijuana bill with provisions covering banking access for legal businesses and expungements of past convictions, citing progress he’s made in discussions with a “bunch of Republican senators.”

During a debate with his Republican reelection opponent Joe Pinion on Sunday, Schumer was asked about a separate broader cannabis legalization bill he filed this year and whether he felt it would make more sense to first promote more research into marijuana before ending prohibition.

While the top senator said that research is “very, very important,” he pointed out that “many states have approved legalization of cannabis,” and so the policy is already “upon us.”

Indicators including the inversion of the yield curve between 10-year and three-month Treasuries -- a recession indicator with a perfect record -- “all support a Fed pivot sooner rather than later,” Wilson wrote in a note on Monday. “Therefore, this week’s Fed meeting is critical for the rally to continue, pause or even end completely.”

All eyes will be on the US central bank, which is widely expected to raise rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday for a fourth time, while investors will be dissecting Chair Jerome Powell’s commentary for guidance on future moves. US stocks have rallied over the past two weeks as traders parsed economic indicators for signs of the impact of Fed tightening, even as Big Tech earnings disappointed.

“This kind of price action isn’t unusual toward the end of the cycle particularly as the Fed moves closer to the end of its tightening campaign, something we think is approaching,” said Wilson, who was ranked the best portfolio strategist in the latest Institutional Investor survey. The rally will hold up until the next 12-month earnings-per-share estimates pull back more meaningfully, he said.

Separately, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists said the potential down shift in the pace of Fed tightening, coupled with light positioning and anticipation of strong fourth-quarter seasonality is behind the lift for equity markets in recent weeks.

I do believe in time the market will recover but we very well could see further declines before we get a solid rebound/support. I think we need to see an end to the Ukraine war and the tapering of inflation world wide before we will see a sustained broad market gain. 

As of recently we’ve seen some price stability in many different industries, with energy leading the pack. This very well could be the support I mentioned but with the amount of uncertainty still world wide, any macro event will cause greater uncertainty and further price declines. While short term levels appear to be holding in the broad market, a break of this support would lead us to retest the March 2020 lows.

My thesis is based on:

-online sentiment is garbage. Hosts and guests all complaining about bookings, fees, algorithms

-travel season is slowing down. Pandemic is over. Not getting that boost in bookings from people stuck at home. 

-the fees have gotten to a point where hotels are more attractive. I think that’s has been the case for long enough to have the market digest and suffer the consequence. I believe it will be reflected in revs.

-I heard insiders have been selling but I am not familiar enough with the company itself to rationalize exactly why. 

-regulation in some markets. 

-the niche has been bastardized by hosts looking to make a living on short term hostel style rentals. Abnb was useful for unique venues or renting a place that is otherwise not available through traditional travel avenues. Renting a bullshit converted room for $350+fees for the night is not what suits Abnb. 

-even if earnings are decent coming off of summer, I expect forward guidance to sink 

-earnings has been rough for all tech

-they trade at a hubris 50-60x P/E ratio 

Counter points: 

-travel stocks have been doing well. 

-market is irrational 

-we are still coming off of summer booking numbers this quarter which may be decent 

-people love future growth companies like Abnb

79,wallstreetbets,MechanicMan657,self.wallstreetbets,5,Index &amp; US Cap Funds Vs Retirement Funds: Which is better for year to year (aggressive) growth?,"I have just started a job recently and they have a retirement package through fidelity. I went over the package several times and I am curious about which is a better selection for me to put my aftertax funds into my retirement account. 

**Are the S&amp;P 500index/US Small/Mid Cap Index a better choice for retirement planning than the Target Retirement funds?** 

Right now through fidelity it lists that as of 09/12/2022:

S&amp;P 500 index has a 1Y return of 28.71%

US Small/Mid Cap Index 1Y return of 12.51%

while (based on my birthday) the Target Retirement 2065 fund 1Y return is 16.57% (MSCI US broad Mkt is 26.10% which might be better choice than just the target retirement since it is a blend of a few things)

I have always had the impression that the S&amp;P 500 index is a more predictable and reliable growth for a portfolio than the basic Target Retirement (20XX) funds. Which buckets would you put your money into to get more aggressive returns in the next 20 years? 

Are there other funds that I should look into to get more aggressive returns with? For example the Large Cap Equity Fund such as the Russell 1000?",0.67,2,0,2,question,2022-10-31T03:50:32Z,yhxhaj,t3

Here's a situation I'm trying to wrap my head around.

Purely  for day trading purposes, when there is no intention of holding  overnight, we're often presented with a situation where we can choose to  trade Index / Index ETFs options or options on a particular stock we expect a higher percentage move from.  There might be relative  strength we can play off of in individual issues, but strategically, how do we best balance that vs the dramatic convexity possible with zero  days?

I was faced with this choice  last week trading SPY options or NFLX and feel like this is a topic  where I could improve my understanding, and therefore, my results.

I  think this must have to do with the size and probability of the  expected move, but that's going to interact with the options pricing.  I  know this has to do with the convexity and gamma, but I'm trying to get  my head around that in a way that's useful for real time day trading  (NOT scalping).

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%. (Stats as of 2022-10-28)",0.87,31,0,31,dd,2022-10-31T02:25:33Z,yhvd9j,t3

Quickly as for the European Economy it is worth noting that Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase.

Counter point and what investors should know :


For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic. This includes recent conclusions by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the EU’s Assessment Group on Glyphosate (AGG), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), and the leading health authorities in Germany, Australia, Korea, Canada, New Zealand, and Japan.

Natural-gas prices have fallen more than 40% since hitting shale-era highs in late August, reducing the risk of [budget-busting heating bills](https://www.wsj.com/articles/higher-heating-bills-poised-to-hit-u-s-households-this-winter-11665805210?mod=article_inline) this winter for millions of Americans and potentially easing a major cost pressure for manufacturers.

The decline is due to warm autumn weather, record domestic production and gas-storage facilities that have filled up fast since the end of air-conditioning season. Now, one of the big drivers of inflation costs roughly the same as it did a year ago. 

Analysts warn that unusually cold weather could send prices soaring anew this winter, [especially in the Northeast](https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-england-risks-winter-blackouts-as-gas-supplies-tighten-11665999002?mod=article_inline) where maxed out pipelines have effectively capped output from Appalachia’s prolific producers.

Yet many are forecasting that prices will be lower on average in 2023 than they were this year. They expect rising supply from increasingly efficient North American drillers along with slower-growing demand from an economy throttled back by central bankers trying to [slow inflation with higher borrowing costs](https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-set-to-raise-rates-by-0-75-point-and-debate-size-of-future-hikes-11666356757?mod=article_inline). 

Natural-gas futures priceSource: Dow Jones Market DataNote: Front-month contractsNov. 2020'21'2212345678$9per million British thermal units

Natural-gas futures for December delivery ended Friday at $5.684 per million British thermal units, just 4.75% higher than a year ago. Early last week, futures slipped below $5 for the first time since March, when energy markets were jolted by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Permian Basin producers in recent days swamped the Waha trading hub in West Texas, pushing prices into negative territory. In some cash trades, sellers paid buyers more than $1 per million British thermal units to take away gas that was fetching more than $8 at the start of September, according to S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights.

 

Analysts say futures prices are likely to rise a bit once furnaces fire up and a big liquefied-natural-gas export terminal in Texas resumes operations following [a fire this summer](https://www.wsj.com/articles/natural-gas-prices-plunge-after-extended-outage-at-texas-lng-facility-11655235895?mod=article_inline). But they expect prices to decline next year.

Goldman Sachs analysts forecast that benchmark U.S. prices would average $5 per million British thermal units in 2023. BofA Securities anticipates $4.50. Through Friday, natural-gas futures this year have averaged about $6.60 per million British thermal units, straining not just household budgets but also the gas-consuming makers of materials ranging from steel and cement to plastic and [fertilizer](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chemicals-giant-to-cut-production-of-key-fertilizer-ingredient-amid-russian-gas-crisis-11658918219?mod=article_inline).

Investors are betting on cheaper gas, too. Hedge funds and other speculators in recent weeks have built up their biggest collective wager that prices will fall since the panic selloff during the Covid lockdown in early 2020, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show.

Rising natural-gas prices have been a safe bet since the early days of the pandemic. Some of the hottest weather on record stretched supplies at home and abroad, while the closure of [coal-fired power plants](https://www.wsj.com/articles/red-hot-coal-prices-threaten-more-increases-in-power-bills-11654167025?mod=article_inline) left electricity producers without an alternative to natural gas. After Ukraine was invaded, European utilities and manufacturers bid up boatloads of shale gas to [replace Russian exports](https://www.wsj.com/articles/nord-stream-blasts-were-likely-result-of-sabotage-german-probe-finds-11666016047?mod=article_inline).

U.S. natural-gas inventories ended the past heating season drawn down to nearly 18% below normal levels. Another steamy summer, strong exports and restraint among North American drillers [focused on shoveling cash to their shareholders](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-surging-natural-gas-prices-havent-sparked-a-drilling-boom-11651623490?mod=article_inline) kept domestic storage facilities from filling up much. By August, stockpiles were still nearly 13% below normal and [prices pushed above $10](https://www.wsj.com/articles/endless-demand-spurs-u-s-natural-gas-prices-to-shale-era-highs-11661245053?mod=article_inline) for the first time since 2008, when the shale-drilling boom was [just getting started](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-texas-well-that-started-a-revolution-1530270010?mod=article_inline).  

Mild weather in September meant a lot less gas burned to power air conditioners. Meanwhile, U.S. production [rose to a record](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-news-today-09-19-2022/card/u-s-natural-gas-output-hit-a-record-high-inJ6nHpFHfQkMNYSXVo5?mod=article_inline) of more than 100 billion cubic feet a day and the prolonged outage at Freeport LNG’s Texas export terminal made available a lot of gas that otherwise would have been sold overseas. 

Traders began pumping more gas into storage tanks and caverns, socking it away for winter when demand is greatest.

Between Sept. 9 and Oct. 14, 571 billion cubic feet of gas were added to stockpiles, the biggest build ever over five weeks. The deficit to normal levels shrank by more than half. As of a week ago, the volume of gas in storage was within 5.5% of normal levels for this time of year, according to the Energy Information Administration.

 

Matthew Palmer, executive director of Global Gas at S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights, said the firm expects U.S. inventories to fill even more and begin winter in line with recent years, at around 3.6 trillion cubic feet. 

“That should be ample for most weather scenarios,” he said. A really cold winter, however, like the frigid season of 2013-14, which sucked nearly 3 trillion cubic feet from storage, could push prices north of $10, he said. ",0.9,42,0,42,news,2022-10-31T00:41:32Z,yhsg96,t3

95,wallstreetbets,v10climbz,self.wallstreetbets,28,Diamondback Energy for the Win. (FANG),"So let me teach you degenerates a little about the oil and gas industry. They have a P/E ratio of 7.45 their EV/EBITDA is steadily decreasing its currently at around a 10.0. Debt to equity ratio is around .41 and continues to decline over the past five years. When looking into oil companies you need to understand something called proven reserves. These are the oil/gas reserves the company has access to but doesn’t utilize all at one time. They have it under lease (mineral lease) per acre of land. Almost all their reserves are in Texas which isn’t a bad things. Often oil companies list these reserves on their balance sheet or especially their income statements. Be very wary of companies that do this. Diamond Back isn’t one of them. 

They have 1.8 billion barrels of oil under their control. Which is very good they can keep the wheel spinning for years. They deal primarily in unconventional shale horizontal drilling operations. That basically means they drill down into a porous oil rich shale rock turn the drill head into the oil producing zone and go horizontally for a couple miles. They then put a perforator with explosive charges on it and send it down into the hole. They then blow up the shale allowing the oil and gas to flow smoothly. They have multiple years of drilling possibilities and peak production in the Permian basin isn’t expected until 2028. Plenty of time for profit to be made. I wouldn’t hold this company for more then two years because their business model isn’t going to last forever, just long enough for the stock price to move up as the continue to increase their cash flow. Their operating cash flow jumped to 3.5 billion last quarter. These wells in the Permian and Eagle Ford shale can be redrilled in multiple directions and multiple depths. All you need to know is Permian Basin/Eagle Ford/west Texas/Eastern New Mexico is all very prime drilling opportunities rich with oil and accessible drilling formations. It’s cheap to drill in Texas. The average break even price for the Eagle Ford is actually 49$ per barrel for a new well. These shale wells won’t produce for more then four years so these companies will eventually be in trouble but that prediction is far from the 10ks they’ll produce over the next five years. 

But talking about oil companies we also need to talk about the price of oil. Most of these oil companies in west Texas produce profit at 53$ a barrel for new wells. There’s a lot of money to be made. OPEC+ supply cuts seem like they’re here to stay. Inflation seems high as well. Projecting oil WTI at around 85-105 a barrel for the next year. Record profits to be expected yet the P/E ration in oil and gas is low. Nobody thinks oil is the future. It isn’t but these companies and their liquidity streams aren’t going anywhere in the next five years. Revenue will keep going up for small/medium cap US shale producers. Record profits to be expected yet no one is holding these companies because they don’t wanna seem environmentally unconscious. They’re a bargain for the retail investors. Some of the best value in the market is in the oil and gas sector. DM me for more oil companies.

Here’s their 10k

I'm ash and write detailed DD on stocks and events, so last week I published my Full plan and analysis.In this post, we will cover

* $2k to $100k Challenge Update
* This week’s Earnings
* This Week's Major Economic Events
* This week’s Watchlist
* This Week’s lotto 10 bagger Play

Ok so let's get this show on the road

# $2k to $100k Challenge Update

For those of you who dont know, im 17 trading days in challenge where i trade live everyday, starting with $2k (actually $1.8k) and trade my way to $100k, live in front of everyone everyday.

**Options Starting Amount:** $1000

**Day 17 Closing Amount:** $5038

**Port % Change:** 400%  
**Proof:**

https://preview.redd.it/m7dh205b10x91.jpg?width=1633&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ecf4dece8117c832473836daf9665ea89ced868

**Futures/Commodities Starting Amount:** $800

**Day 17 Closing Amount:** $1500

**Port % Change**: %87.5

I found that people for the most are not really interested in Global/Futures plays, but if you guys want i can definitely add that to the watchlist next week. Let me know in the comments.

This week we gained big by predicting 2 main moves, the drop on the GDP release, we ran on very bad news for Feds, the drop was inevitable. And another big gainer was PCE release, got in PM into SPX calls when i saw Bullish divergence between price action and RSI and added size after PCE meet expectation as it was good news for the Feds and PCE is one of powells favorite metrics to look at for rate hikes.

The following is basically my plan for next week.

# Major Economic Events

**Monday 10/31**

9:45 AM Chicago PMI

10:00 AM Dallas Fed Manufacturing Index Oct

**Tuesday 11/01**

9:45 AM S&amp;P Global PMI Final Oct

10:00 AM ISM Manufacturing PMI Oct

10:00 AM Jolts Job Openings Sep

**Wednesday 11/02**

8:15 AM ADP Employment Change Oct

2:00 PM Fed Interest Rate Decision

2:30 PM Fed Press Conference

**Thursday 11/03**

8:30 AM Balance of Trade Sep

10:00 AM ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI Oct

**Friday 11/04**

8:30 AM Non Farm Payroll Oct

8:30 AM Unemployment Rate Oct

So all these are very important events that will move the market, but the offcourse the important event is the Fed Conference on wednesday which is the only event ill playing.

So my play here is in 2 parts.

Part 1 - The Rate Hike

Believe it or not the rate hike is not that important and is unlikely to affect the market that much, let me explain.

https://preview.redd.it/owgfdped10x91.png?width=1262&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a466d5bcb721e09c65cc449128a726a17b262b77

As of Friday 28Oct the market is pricing

0% chance of 100Bps

81.3% chance of 75Bps

18.7% chance of 50Bps

Now in my previous watchlist we have been predicting the rate hikes right every single time by just following the highest odds, the Fed doesnt like to freak the market. They also dont want the market to rally too much so its also unlikely that we get 50Bps, in addition to that why do 50Bps when they can get away with 75Bps without freaking out the market.

In all cases, they definitely not doing 100bps, if they do 75bps as expected we run a little (ill tell why a little later on) if they 50Bps we run alot. It seems to me for the first part the very obvious play here is calls before the rate hike, and sell on the spike for that delicious IV spiked premium.

Part 2 - The Meeting

Well this is where it gets very tricky, so as you may know that market has been rallying lately and thats because alot of people are expecting the Fed to pivot, or at least start talking about pivoting this time.

If they say we are pivoting the run continues at least till we hit the 200MA on the SPX 1D chart, if they we cant do that yet, we are getting new 52 week lows.

This part is easy to figure the part is figuring out whether they will pivot or not, for funsies ill give you my expectations, but honeslty im going to play it by ear. Im 50/50 on what they plan to do, and the move will be so big you can get in at time and still make $$, you can also do a straddle.

Anyway Looking at the PCE report inflation is not so bad, thats why ran hard after the report was out, its not the best report in the world, but its an improvement for sure, add to that the St. Louis Fed came out with report stating the Fed is wrong to look only at CPI as it is lagging data heavily weight down with rent prices going up and that if we remove rent, inflation has actually cooled off and we are actually deflating now.

The fed doesnt want to risk deflation by forcing a recession when we dont really need to. (This is a much worse scenario than inflation, thats why the Fed is being careful)

On the other hand, GDP came out pretty damn positive, the so called earnings recession and end of the world stock market destruction is nowhere to be seen. While some growth tech companies ‘’missed’’ (most of them just lowered guidance, they didnt actually miss) most of the not so sexy companies beat. This is good for the stock market, VERY bad for the feds, this means that demand is not getting crushed, and if demand is high, prices will likely remain elevated. So all this might signal to the Fed that job not done yet, we need more pain.

As you can see there are very good reasons for the Fed to go either way, i think we get a pivot for an important reason no one is really talking about. The US treasuries the most liquid market in the world, is losing its liquidity. With UK and Japan selling US Treasures to prop up their currienses and markets and the Fed tightening and no longer buying assets this is starting to affect the treasuries market.

Guys if treasure market goes no bid or crashes, 2008 + 2001 + Great depression will NOT even come close to the global collapse that we might experience. Central Banks Chairs around the world have been pestering Powell about that recently. I think they will do anything to make sure that doesnt happen.

But like i said we shall see.

# Watchlist

**- $TSLA Long**

https://preview.redd.it/xf5d6mcf10x91.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0ee3eae96a82cee42fcf3f93488dfd70d3e66a5

If TSLA continues its run, and finally break the 230 resistance, we can easily see a run to $250 level, will take calls on Monday

**- $SPY Short**

https://preview.redd.it/q96wt5pg10x91.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=278dc0bbd5025aca467cb822a03603f7ecd7a914

Whether we run or not after FOMC the 1Hr is VERY over extended, and we are due a pullback, its not going to be a sharp one likely but still could make for a nice trade.

**- $PIN Long**

https://preview.redd.it/em2jx6hh10x91.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=754fa108ef21a21dc4a22bb0b10c6c4d855fd71c

Strong beat by PINS still has room for more if it breaks the $25.9 resistance we can get $27.95, quickly, taking some call here for a possible run

**- $DB Short**

https://preview.redd.it/bt550y5i10x91.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20ba5802ea52e0d4b92c01b6f45dd1e765f2b507

Ran so much on that earnings beat, creating a short gap fill to $9.5. Its also very Overbought on the Daily chart making a nice %3 move down at least, picking up some puts as long as it doesnt move down before the open

# Bonus Potential 10 Bagger Play

Alright boys and girls so played this one before as 10 bagger and we got our 10 bag (and then some) But this one has more left in the tank for another run.

Its NFLX baby.

So we ran hard before and on earnings securing our 10 bag ( This was my firs 10bag call on my first watchlist, check my profile for proof).

Now it crossed the 200MA on the daily chart after filling half the gap so take a little rest. What we are looking for here is for NFLX to reclaims 50 and 21MA  on the 1hr time frame. Once we get we reclaim that we will continue to fill the remainder of the gap fill all the way to $330

&amp;#x200B;

Alright, so that's it for this week, ill be doing this every week and going through the previous week’s play to see how much we gained and where we went wrong.

PFE's financials have been stellar during the pandemic. So stellar that they're being investigated for hiding profits. If true, investors should be livid as PFE also pays a dividend and they're opening themselves up to potential IRS back taxes, interest and penalties.

With Covid mostly behind us, they're mitigating declining sales with a price hike.

Pfizer has proven themselves when it comes to vaccines. They're fully able to develop, test, manufacture and distribute when other countries are still going into lockdowns. Let's also give credit to Johnson and Johnson, Moderna and the little guys for creating the competitive environment. Whatever PFE reports on Tuesday, it will surely drag these guys with them.

My take on the future. Covid vaccine sales will continue to decline as we move forward and the other divisions within Pfizer will continue to flat line with little to no growth.

Well here we are today: 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jxh9aqfteyw91.png?width=777&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06f32f3d05c6bc26be5ff18152c866a2f8002709

The ""next meeting"": 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ghkwxf4cfyw91.png?width=775&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=073a9298174403edcdc2b943669d6bcc325510df

So what is happening here? Well somehow the idea of a 50 point hike next meeting has creeped into the odds and especially over the last week went from 5% to 17.8%. 75 is still ""expected"" but its interesting to see a window open to this idea. 

The next meeting calls for 125-150 bps by the Dec meeting. The odds of 125 are going up while the 150 is going down. Well why is this and what does the market know that you don't? Lets start with the obvious: 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mgqaiyusgyw91.png?width=1072&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=afd95fb2cf12131dae02f2c184c1c0f1aff47d4e

See that initial 6% rise and 8% crash? Thats the market being under the impression the fed is doing two 75bps hikes in a row. But something happened on the CPI day (the big green bar there). The CPI report was not good. It did not show CPI came down. They told you the market was ""oversold"" and ""due for a bounce"". But narratives are always built after the price action was decided. 

Well lets keep in mind the date the CPI report was posted 

&amp;#x200B;

[Oct 13 for the smooth brain](https://preview.redd.it/6ntp5dqfhyw91.png?width=1044&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1021a7ef90945a09b36465e209ef329f9eba543c)

""Last Friday"" was Oct 14th, the day after the CPI report was posted and the market retreated back, only to close higher and never return to this level again. How long does it take to setup a meeting? 24 hours? Whoever bought up the CPI day simply knew something we all don't. Then word gets out after the Friday meeting and the market only gets bought up. 

They know the fed's next meeting before its even occurred. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pl1sbwo5jyw91.png?width=599&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1863e87751ef465b2d537d8119cf729962aa67e8

If you knew the fed was going to get all flowery and use some fancy pivot language the market can interpret as bullish and run with, you would buy everything up too, especially at those beautiful lows we had. 

To those paying attention, the fed is basically telling you without telling you all the way back on the 21st:

So the fed does a dovish meeting. The market can't rally that hard...right?  Wrong:  


[July 25-Aug 23. First big green bar is the July 27 fed meeting](https://preview.redd.it/1n27swtdkyw91.png?width=1067&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e38b5ad34742acb1667c2928a807bf04ff583a3d)

Just the broader market went on to rally a good 10% from the previous days level. So what if it did it again? 

&amp;#x200B;

Well to get back and re-test that Aug high, you would need an 11% rally (greater than the last one), thus it is already built out to fail making a higher high and simply fall back down again later. We have no idea what number they will send the market to in front of the meeting so we can't measure it out, but one thing we can deduce is that there is some extremely heavy volume with the market being low like it was. This indicates incredible interest at these price levels. AKA accumulation for the next move.  Now are all these accumulators just going to paper hands when they just got done buying tf out of the market? No. They are going to let the sneeze play out and let short coverings/you drive the market up after the fed meeting. 

What will they do with the prices in front of the meeting? Who honestly knows. Probably send the market down a lil and then show you some fancy charts about why it was ""overbought"" and blah blah blah just for you to witness the entire market up another 5% a week from now. Probably some profit takers and re buy ins in front of it is how itll go. 

&amp;#x200B;

A rally here into at least mid November makes sense also from the standpoint this is a strong seasonal period for stocks especially around midterms. It is highly unlikely JPOW is going to get up there and call for a 1 bps this meeting and next in front of something highly political like this. Besides, Powell is already getting political pressure now:

Well here is how that all went down:  


https://preview.redd.it/itz5j2stoyw91.png?width=825&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=007f6a54cf0f897f932b501aad6b377254c843f3

You can see the market was going through it heading into the mid terms. But some miracle occurred that put the crash on hold between the specific dates of Oct 29th and Nov 8th there was something special about that day. Who knows what that could have been about. I just have no idea! 

You heard before ""Dec is a great time to buy stocks! Its so seasonally strong! The consumer can bench press $500k worth of debt and squat another $1 milly!"" 

There's an old fashioned phrase in the game called exit liquidity. These banks all calling for a recession in 2023 are not wrong. But if you got caught flat footed (we know  some already did aka credit swiss\*) then you need to pass your bags along because all that bully the market rhetoric from Powell caught you off guard and your bags are getting a little too heavy lately. Dec was perfect last hike cycle for exit liquidity, will probably be again. 

I lastly leave you with the beautiful game of guessssssssssssss that chart! Can you guess what caused it to run in the first place and why it stopped? These all are random popular stocks from 07/27-08/16 on an hourly timeframe:

Of that, due to high insider and institutional holdings, only about 10 million are available for trading. 20 million shares short interest give it a 200% SI. $GME had SI of 150% at its high. Not saying my calculated setup is a guarantee for a squeeze but a good start. Daily price swings on low volume indicate that the stock is tight as hell.

Also, $GEO, while still heavily leveraged has underlying assets that give the company a fair share price of about $20, based on reproduction values of recent transactions. Not even included here is their subsidiary which is a cash machine.

It‘s basically one of a few stocks that will hold up during a recession, make their interest payments leverage less problematic relative to the increasing rates in general, and provide a big margin of safety, since the company provides enough FCF to deleverage and has enough assets to sell for deleveraging.

34,wallstreetbets,lospepes0,self.wallstreetbets,16,Bullish case for growth stocks,"Growth stocks have been hammered this year because of the prospect of higher interest rates. 
Using the future discounted cashflows valuation, higher interest rates mean higher discount rates in the denominator of the cashflows and lower valuations.
However, higher inflation increases the multiplers of the cashflows and the valuations. 

What matters is the annual difference between inflation and interest rates. The higher the difference, the higher the valuation. 

Another factor is that companies may have lower returns in the next couple of years due to a recession, which lowers their valuation. 

My point is: 

Growth stocks don't need to worry as much about lower short term returns. Their short term returns were going to be small anyways compared to their long term returns. 

No need to worry about interest rates much either. They are still well below the inflation rate and the FED can't increase rates too much for too long because that will crash the economy and make national debt unsustainable. If they crash the economy they will have to lower rates again and keep doing more QE lol 

On the other hand, we can't control inflation as much. There's currently a trend towards reversing globalization, which will increase prices no matter what interest rates are. This will decrease the revenue of many companies buying/selling goods internationally. However, a lot of growth stocks SELL services internationally, mostly software, communications, and entertainment. They aren't affected by commodities as much. Higher inflation means higher returns for these companies over the long run, which should increase their valuation. Plus many these companies have already fallen more than 30-40%...

As soon as the markets start to see that interest rates don't go up so much and that inflation is still kind of high, the dollar will plummet and growth stocks will go to the moon 🚀🚀",0.56,2,0,2,question,2022-10-30T03:42:05Z,yh1fb9,t3

55,wallstreetbets,JournalistFew2794,self.wallstreetbets,23,I have elaborated Charts to explain why META plummeted and why we should (if) be concerned,"Here we go. A very clear chart showing the trend of META's **quarterly revenue**, the polemic **R&amp;D expense as a % of total revenue** and the **Free Cash Flow generated in the same period**. I have plotted the last 9 periods (quarters) so you can see the trend and then we will compare with the chart of Meta share price where you will see clearly why/how the market is concerned. 

Take 1 minute to read properly and understand the trend:

[Yes, FCF my friends. The FCF!!!!!!](https://preview.redd.it/e8n65aywxsw91.jpg?width=791&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4a4451bb8606c90e5ebc61359f7a8730f7234d7)

So what is the problem with the above chart?

The FCF has been ERASED! The only big tech that has decided to smash its cash flow generation capacity. Zuck doesn't care. He is all in into the METAVERSE. F\* you shareholders. Investment returns? You should have bought APPLE.

That's why you see the following QoQ share price action in the same period (I have plotted 99$ in Sep 30, but it should be 27 Oct):

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ixamkk9jysw91.jpg?width=791&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78772ec49e6c324d8e4f48add37ba5476178d434

But hold on, what is all that cash burn rate? What is Zuckerberg doing with our cash?

Well he anounced the following:

&amp;#x200B;

|In Billions $|2022|2023|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Total Expenses|86|100|

100 F\*ing Billion per year! Hey Regards, he could be buying your entire GME company 12 times each of these 2 years. 

But... was this a SHHURPRISE? Mmm... no! This is what he already anounced last year, and the stock did a rally from 320$ to the 340$ after releasing this:

&amp;#x200B;

[So still spending 10 Billiones below what he told us for FY2022](https://preview.redd.it/82o77zt30tw91.jpg?width=1560&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97950cce7dfe04df98895f0b8e0ebf757d69e4ef)

The capital he will allocate in CAPEX will be 33-34 Bn$ each year, in 2022 and 2023. This is basically data centers, servers, and network infrastructure. As he says, ""increase in AI capacity""

So...

how is the cash position of META compared to the other big techs? The below data is Cash and Cash equivalent LESS Debt.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/g1h23m1j0tw91.jpg?width=724&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e3dcd3daecd6abddbe16299ebb189ae29ab02a2

The share price is trading where it should be... specially when you see how Apple, Googl and MSFT are already on good track with their business, generating a massive amount of cash. Zuckerberg is DESPERATE and for him this is a survival path. 

OCULUS is unique. We can't discuss this. He is leading the hardware of the METAVERSE. The issue is the software, games, education, office/work application... we still have a close to none adoption rate I'd say, that's why market is skeptic. Should we give him a chance?

CCP will try to invade Taiwan within the next 24 months. Either directly or in directly by way of military force. CCP will mess with Tesla production in china by pushing their home grow EV’s or as drastically as taking over Tesla production plant and technology….Elon will start to panic, he will advocate for CCP peace meal by using twitter platform for the west not to intervene in china’s aggression. 

Back to the Ruskies: Elon is attempting to play both sides right now. He sees Russia as a major market for Tesla vehicles but also for the raw materials for batteries. Why do you think he’s trying to play both sides asking for Ukraine to accept Russians demand of signing over the land to them. 

Elon only cares about Elon. He is seeking complete dominance by pretending to care about humanity. Autocrats are his friend now. No democracy will play hiss bullshiit games. Why do you think drumpt has tried to make friendship with NK, Russkies, etc…

Tesla will be facing major competition in the EV space in the next 2-3 losing market space to VW, F, and GM. Elon will transform into a lunatic billionaire pushing his agenda against any other human rights violation. 

TLDR; Elon the welfare queen has built an empire by using the left and now using the right. Tax subsidies and tax avoidance is Elon’s strategy followed by sucking up to autocrats for Tesla gains by means of human loses.

# Scalping Review

SPY opened at that 380 range and held (important level to hold as noted in last post). It started its first leg. It came back down to 380.96 at around 8:12 UTC-6 and tested 20 MA and AVWAP. It bounced and continued upward, completing another leg and half or so. For the next hour and half, SPY traded in a large flat top triangle - getting three bounces off the 385.04 line on the scalping chart. SPY broke out of the triangle at 10:15 UTC-6 and backtested twice. The 388.96 full measured move was hit EOD. SPY continued it’s uptrend and traded in a rectangle from 11:10 UTC-6 to 12:32 UTC-6. It broke out and hit 388.96 full measured move EOD. We closed right around 389.34 line on scalping chart.

I found some time to trade in the AM before I went golfing. I took four trades. I played the second leg of the uptrend.

I played the breakout of rectangle to half measured move. It took two attempts for me as I was stopped out on the first try.

# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

US stocks ended a volatile week with a sizable gain as Apple's earnings report boosted technology shares and a smattering of economic data suggested the Federal Reserve is making some progress in its battle against inflation.

  
The S&amp;P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 both posted their longest weekly gains since August. Gains in major technology companies such as Microsoft and Google Parent Alphabet aided both indexes in reversing a two-day decline.

  
Treasuries fell on Friday, snapping a three-day rally, as hopes of a Fed pivot faded. The dollar rose for the second day in a row.

  
This week, stocks, bonds, and the dollar swung wildly as investors tried to make sense of conflicting earnings reports and economic data.

  
Quarterly reports from megacap tech names underscored the impact of the Fed’s tightening regime, and consequently the surging dollar.

  
Meanwhile, a core measure of US inflation increased in September, strengthening the Fed's case for another jumbo rate hike next week. However, a contraction in manufacturing and services, as well as lower-than-expected US home sales, indicated that the Fed's actions were already having an impact on the economy. The release of gross domestic product data on Thursday temporarily allayed fears of a recession.

  
Economists continue to expect the Fed to raise interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point next week, for the fourth time in a row. Rates are expected to rise another half point in December, followed by quarter point increases in the next two meetings.

## 65 min. Chart

* Starting to see SPY turn over a little bit - notice the rounding top trying to form. If 390 holds as resistance on Monday, I’ll be looking for 387.32 - 385.00.
* If we gap up to 395 ish and top of resistance, I’ll be looking to fade to 390.
* If we gap down to 385 ish, Ill be looking to see if 385 holds, and play either way - calls to 390 - 395 or puts to 381.50 - 379.16 - 377.00

## Trend-based Extension

* 1.618 golden ratio puts us at 407.68
* 20 MA currently at 410.35
* If the trend continues, this range is where I’d start looking for a top.

9,wallstreetbets,NOVUS_ORDO_SECLORUM6,self.wallstreetbets,29,Are your shares being delivered - SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 ?,"SEC. 17A. NATIONAL SYSTEM FOR CLEARANCE AND SETTLEMENT OF SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS

(a)(1) The Congress finds that—
(A) The **prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions**, including the transfer of record ownership and the safeguarding of securities and funds related thereto, are necessary for the protection of investors and persons facilitating transactions by and acting on behalf of investors.

(a)(2)(A) The Commission is directed, therefore, having due *regard* for the public interest, the protection of investors, the safeguarding of securities and funds, and maintenance of fair competition among brokers and dealers, clearing agencies, and transfer agents, to use its authority under this title—
(i) to facilitate the establishment of a national system for the **prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of transactions in securities**

(b)(3) A clearing agency shall not be registered unless the Commission determines that—

(A) Such clearing agency is so organized and has the capacity to be able to **facilitate the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions and derivative agreements, contracts, and transactions for which it is responsible**, to safeguard securities and funds in its custody or control or for which it is responsible, to comply with the provisions of this title and the rules and regulations thereunder

(F) The **rules of the clearing agency are designed to promote the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions** and, to the extent applicable, derivative agreements, contracts, and transactions, to assure the safeguarding of securities and funds which are in the custody or control of the clearing agency or for which it is responsible, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in the clearance and settlement of securities transactions, to **remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a national system for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions**, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest

(G) The rules of the clearing agency provide that its participants shall be appropriately disciplined for violation of any provision of the rules of the clearing agency by expulsion, suspension, limitation of activities, functions, and operations, fine, censure, or any other fitting sanction.

(b)(5)(C) A registered clearing agency may summarily **suspend and close the accounts of a participant who** (i) has been and is expelled or suspended from any self-regulatory organization, (ii) **is in default of any delivery of** funds or **securities to the clearing agency**, or (iii) is in such financial or operating difficulty that the clearing agency determines and so **notifies the appropriate regulatory agency** for such participant that such suspension and closing of accounts are necessary for the protection of the clearing agency, its participants, creditors, or investors.

TLDR: SEC is responsible for ensuring clearing agencies, and therefore parties participating in said clearing agencies, never Fail To Deliver (FTD) securities. SEC data from second-half of September 2022 shows 2,687,705,568 FTDs of 68,260 tickers. Yes that’s 2.6 BILLION shares that where **NOT prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions** and the SEC not only has the data but manages the publishing of it.

I will however go through the other 3 pictures to explain the current situation

[Meta analysis 1](https://imgur.com/CRnf0I4)

Meta revenue came in -4.5% lower than the sept 2021 same quarter. As you can see, in 2021, for every 1 dollar of revenue, 64 cents was going to costs. In 2022, for every 1 dollar of revenue, 80 cents is going to cost. We're seeing a 45.66% decline in operating income. Also they are paying 21.18% in taxes which we will use later in our picture 4 calculation.

[Meta analysis 2](https://imgur.com/Qk325WQ)

In the 2021 quarter, eps came in at 3.22 and in the 2022 quarter, eps came in at 1.64. That is essentially a 49% drop. If we're looking at diluted shares outstanding, the number declined by 6% meaning they are outpacing stock based compensation with their buyback program. Their total share based comp expense has increased 31.74% which is understandable given they are growing a new revenue segment

[Meta Analysis 3](https://imgur.com/IUKfISN)

The information here shows the revenue segments and as we can see, from the 2021 quarter to the 2022 quarter, reality labs revenue dropped by 48.92% and the family of apps revenue dropped by 3.6%. Given that reality labs is the segment they are pouring money into, this is highly unwelcoming news. This quarters loss on the reality labs segment also came in significantly higher and compared to 2021 quarter, was 39.57% higher.

[Meta Analysis 4](https://imgur.com/GAb3pG9)

Now if we remove reality labs, EPS would come in around 2.71 versus the 1.64 we got.  That is a 65.24% increase on EPS. Keep in mind that there are shared expenses and getting rid of a segment may not be as oversimplified as I have shown here.

The analyst further praised GTI as one of the ""best-managed MSOs"" with a footprint ""well-placed"" for the launch of recreational sales in the states where it operates.

The company recently teamed up with Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc.'s (OTC: ANCTF) Circle K Stores, an American chain of convenience stores, to sell licensed cannabis at Circle K gasoline retailers in Florida.

However, Florida Health Department told the Washington Examiner that state regulators have not approved the deal.

Meta has destroyed so many trading accounts. I am glad I exited my position a couple months ago. I feel bad for people who lost money because of your failed vision and I am super blessed not be part of none of “Meta” stock.

**Risk management/ Stop losses** 

The answer sadly was right in front of me the whole time… risk management. I am someone that preaches and preaches risk management and small gains till im blue in my server. However, I failed to practice what I preached. 

Lets take a look at the win % of July and August 71.76% vs. my current 84.16% win rate currently. Yes a 84.16% win rates impressive in my opinion but with my strategy I can and should be profitable with a 71.76% win rate? So why was I note profitable? Lets take a look at a few weeks of trades and its pretty easy to see why. 

Note- for those of you who question why I use excel to show my losses/ wins this is why cause I can analyze things in a way that TOS does not let me. 

Now what do you see? In terms of stop losses there were no stop losses. I thought I was smarter then the chart. I thought that I just got a bad bounce and it would come back to me. What I ended up doing was putting myself in such a whole that I couldn’t recover. 

For the week on the left had I closed stuff out at -20% I would have finished the week at +$1974 and on the right I would have closed the week at $1890. Same win rate… but completely different result… So not even changing the loss from a win BUT changing where I close out my loss (and more importantly accepting my loss at -20%) would immediately have turned two of those 6 week green (and actually would have turned every one of those 6 weeks green and even looking back from January to June I believe 90% of my weeks had I closed out at -20% on my losses… and not increased my win rate or anything else… I would have been profitable on every single week.). 

So when people ask me “what did you change?” “its impossible for someone to have 8 green weeks!” “its impossible for someone to recover like that!”

I say no its not… I say and I say this to 90% of people who blow their accounts up or have a green week go red… “where was your stop loss?”   
 

Risk management and mitigating our losses is about 100x more important then taking proifts. There are actually numerous strategies out there that can have 40-60% win rates BUT with proper stop losses can have extremely profitable results. 

There is a rule called the 10/20 rules… the goal should be 10% profits and we should use a HARD -20% stop loss. We can not think about it and we can not try to out smart it. This is another reason I stopped playing 0dte lottos as they would result in -90% losses I could recover. 

Honestly I could stop right here but there is a few other minor things that have helped me.

**Position sizing**

I have talked about this since forever but I always say that your options account should be 10% of your total investment portfolio. That means if you have $10,000 to invest (for simple numbers) you should really only have about $1000 in your options account. And of that 10% you should only be trading with at MOST 10% of the 10%. That means each position size should only be about $100. 

Why? Why so small? We have to assume the worst. If we use $100/ trade on a cash only account (which if you haven’t switched to a cash only account SWITCH NOW!) then we can make about 10 trades per day. That means with the 10/20 rule and about a 70%-80% win rate we can remain profitable every day. Its about quality quantity not one quality trade. This is a mistake I made in July and August also. 

I was so focused on making one good trade that I would end up making a bad trade or wait so long to enter that I would get stopped out immediately. 

Something I did and HIGHLY recommend people do is to size heavily down in times of bad trading… when I recognized in June and July that I was struggling I sized down by 1/5th per trade. And then I sized down another ½ in the really bad times. From there focusing on the % gains not the $ gained I was able to gather myself and now I have gone from $500/ trade to $1000/ trade to $1500/ trade and now im pretty content at about $2000-$2500 per trade and I don’t think I will size up again for a while. Maybe another month or so of consistency and I will size back up. 

The number one goal should always be capital preservation. Remember the light at the end of the tunnel is the end of this bear market and a return to the “easy” times of a bull market. 

**Win rate doesn’t= profit** 

This is something I wish I would have taken to heart even earlier then I did. I had a really respected trader tell me this all the time when I was so proud of my 80% win rate. But he reminded me (and so did my weekly log) that win rate doesn’t equal profitable. There are actually a lot of strats out there where you can be holding a 40-60% win rate and still make money. This plays into the first and most important point of all of this… STOP LOSSES ARE KING. 

**Trusting myself**

This is the last point I want to make. In this market we have to trust ourselves and have confidence in our trades. Something that I experienced in this bear market for the first time was lack of confidence in myself. There was so many times where I would enter a trade (back before my hard set stop loss days) and I would get a rogue $3 green candle (like we saw this week) that would wreck my position beyond belief. I would finally take my loss and then we would see some wild bounce $6 the other way back in my favor. Where had I just held I would end up green. 

This is where this 2022 market is absolutely brutal and I have seen some pretty decent traders wash themselves out of this market. When we lose confidence in ourselves we lose confidence in the plays we make. I struggled with this (and honestly some of it was pressure on myself to be perfect and to never lose cause of the server and I have a lot of eyes on me). But I know im not perfect and I know no matter how perfect a setup works in the end we will never win everytime. Sure it was fun when I had like a 35 green trades in a row win streak but honestly it was just luck. 

What I have learned is when we recognize a trend we do not fight momentum nor do we fight the trend. BUT it is okay to say I don’t like this setup, I don’t like this day, or this isn’t my ideal setup and to sit cash gang. There are so many people who fail to understand the importance of the fact that cash IS a position. You cant lose money sitting cash. WAIT for YOUR setup to come to you. 

Another thing I struggled with for a while was traders paralysis. I had so many things I was waiting to be “perfect” before I entered a trade that by time the crystals would align I would have missed the move already. This plays into my last and final point. 

**Aggressive without being wreckless**

Speaking of trader paralysis what I found is that in waiting for everything to be perfect by time I got into the trade that initial little pop that gets you that 10% in 30 seconds had already pasted and I was left with the bread crumbs of bread crumbs waiting for the 10% pop that never came. 

I found that through those red weeks and endless days and weekends backtesting and backtesting and backtesting I found what works for me. What is the post HIGH PROBABILITY risk to reward plays. In my server often times you’’ll hear me play these “bounce or die” or “die or bounce” plays. 

That is what I mean about high probability plays. Often times these are when the indicators are favoring lets say a call and SPY 15min chart has retraced to a key support and is sitting on it. Everything points to a bounce back up but its not perfect yet. 

I would rather take a play that has a high probability of success then wait so long for confirmation that I end up never seeing profits. I trade a fine line between aggressive and wreckless. With the 10/20 rule a 0dte gives you enough wiggle room to be slightly off on timing with being aggressive BUT if you are too aggressive (aka wreckless) then you end up just stopping out and then it plays out how you expected. 

I hope this helps you guys if you have any questions let me know!",0.8,45,0,45,question,2022-10-29T02:19:56Z,yg3o0m,t3

Lets flash back to last Friday… The beginning of of the week had a nice green two days followed by a doji Wednesday and a hammer candle on Thursday. This hammer candle showed downside potential and after hours did too. Then Friday came and out of no where ripped a 2.45% green day… Flash forward to this week its nearly an identical movement. I mean 100% identical. Scary at best. 

Today I am not too proud to admit I misplayed 100% and I unknowingly was far to bearish and bet against the markets. The worst part is… I even called this weekly rally last week in my weekly TA.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/a3a56ccw7mw91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f85daeb5ea4b1cf9f4dac4f908e24f3738ffc38

Guess I should trust myself a little more huh? I definitely got blinded by the big tech earning misses, GDP coming in hot af, PCE/ PMI, job claims, etc etc etc. all of that was bearish af for the week. But what happened? Market didn’t care… why? Because the markets still believe JPOW is going to say on Wednesday at 230pm for FOMC (stay tuned this weekend I will release the FOMC trading plan to the server) that “we have inflation under control or we don’t wanna over shoot on rate hikes so we will look to slow down our hikes in December.”

This is why we are rallying in my opinion. 

So where does this leave us next week… well this is the scenarios I forsee. 

Monday and Tuesday I have pinned for a bullish because we really don’t have anything on the books negative wise. I don’t forsee anything economic or macro wise to really bring us down and its pretty clear by this weeks movements and recovery that bulls are in control and the markets is not going to sell off (I misplayed that today). 

Wednesday is FOMC day… I expect a green day. Now the question will be does JPOW rightfully say “we have not controlled inflation and while we do not want to overshoot rate hikes we need to slow inflation first” if he says this then we should look for a dump into CPI. However, if he says “I believe inflation is tamed and we will see the effects of that on the next CPI and going forward and that should allow us to slow our rate hikes… slow not pause…” we are going to rally. 

From there I honestly don’t forsee CPI coming in as a beat at all.. it actually is going to probably be a huge miss… if you remember back in August when CPI came in hot they held off on releasing the consensus (just like now) until we got very close to CPI… I have a feeling after or the day of FOMC we will see the consensus finally released. Which will allow me to accurately predict next CPI…   
 

Regardless of whether we rally or dump after FOMC I expect us to get a bad CPI reading and I will be looking for a repeat of August. What I think is happening is a tactful unwinding of the VIX prior to FOMC and CPI to avoid the crash once again. It seems like this is the general strategy that has happened time and time again. We get these rallies through bad news, and every dip is a buying opportunity where the technical make zero sense (such as this morning where VOLD was extreme bearish and nearly extreme bearish however we saw markets continue to rip). 

In short im bullish till Wednesday then we will take it from there… 

&amp;#x200B;

In short SPY has maintained this red bull channel for 2 weeks now and until I see this bull channel broken I will remain bullish. I am seeing today we made a really nice double bottom off 379.8 which also was a daily 8ema support test and hold (this is the big play I over looked today with my bearish bias). In addition we put in a 2 day (almost 3) bullish engulfing daily candle. With maintaining and holding within this green channel and failing to retrace through it I am seeing that a 390.1 resistance test will be coming on Monday. The question is do we level up and push for the 400s before FOMC or do we reject that 390 level Monday and actually spend some time consolidating before FOMC. 

Fun note- this week is now the only the 2nd time this year that markets have put in a green week the week before FOMC the other time was July. 

If and when we break through 390 then I will be looking as the 50% retracement line of the bear channel and start eyeing 405.1 as next level resistance. I am not quite convinced that we will have the steam to get there but I do think we could take 395-400 before FOMC or on FOMC day (if jpow is bullish). 

However, if Monday we reject 390.1 channel resistance I would look for this red bull channel support to be tested and see if that 380 support holds. The one thing to note is that this is the first time a candle has closed over 388.6 since September 22nd.

Funny enough about this weekly candle is that this candle last night was showing a 100% different story. However, todays candle is our 2nd green week in a row and our first back to back green weeks since August. With this candle I look for continuation, however, we did fall just short of breaking through the weekly 20ema. We will need to take that level out then we can start looking at that next major level resistance of 408.9. 

If we double top of the weekly 20ema we could see a retracement back to that 375.6 weekly level. 

Key support- 385.2 -&gt; 375.6 -&gt; 363.7

Key resistance- 390 -&gt; 399.8 -&gt; 409.9

Futures put in a massive green day today and dead ended right at that 3925 level which just so happens to be its daily 100ema. On the bullish side of things you can see we held the daily 8ema as support today, reconfirmed 3800 as support and broke through the bear channel from August. There is no longer (besides the 2022 bear channel resistance) downward resistance to watch for. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fscdh1z28mw91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e808dce0070bfd9ff8ae8db162339380956d5f3

Futures actually was able to close over the weekly 20ema. However, as you can see it fell just short of breaking through the orange channel level resistance of 3925. Next week we will look for futures to turn 3925 into support which should open up an opportunity for futes to test next level resistance around 4085. 

Key support- 3870 -&gt; 3770 -&gt; 3705

Key resistance- 3925 -&gt; 4005 -&gt; 4085

Apple put in one hell of an impressive day today making a total intraday movement of $9.68 which was 179% of its 10day average range. It also put in 175% of its 30day average volume today. People poured into Apple today. I think people found their “safe haven.”

Apple actually broke through its bull channels resistance and topped out right at 157.5 resistance today. With that being where apple hit and retraced we will look for that as key resistance to break over next week. 

This is the first time Apple has closed over the 8, 20, 50, 100 and 200 ema since September 12th. 

&amp;#x200B;

Apple weekly played perfectly off the levels… for those who say TA don’t work or that you cant TA stuff when its parabolic… today even on a ridiculously big move Apple still respected levels. These chart levels were untouched and it closed right under that key 157.5 weekly level. 

With apple bounced off that red support line, holding 147.2 as support and closing over all the EMAs we should naturally look for some upside next week. 

Key support- 150.6 -&gt; 147.3 -&gt; 141.2

Key resistance- 155.8 -&gt; 161.2

My love and hate relationship with Tesla is unmatched by anything else. Tesla provided me with 3 huge wins 3 days in a row, however, today I became too bearish and burnt myself playing some level to level plays. Now that I am being more objective I actually see a pretty bullish case for tesla next week. 

We came back down and tested the daily 8ema and managed to close back over that. However, we did fall just short of 230 resistance and the daily 20ema resistance. Tesla looked like it had no sense of direction today and that could have possibly been related to the twitter deal being completed today. 

With this hanging man candle on the daily I am looking for a repeat of 10/24/22 and will look to see a bigger push up on Tesla Monday/ next week. We are right at key resistance for the blue bear channel which lies at 228 for Monday. 

There is a case to be made as I mentioned earlier this week that tesla is establishing a consolidation channel from 205 to 230 and honestly until we close over 230 we haven’t officially broken that trend yet. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tesla still has a daily and weekly gap at 262.47 to fill. I don’t forsee that filling next week but with a bullish enough sentiment and bullish enough FOMC its not out of the realm of possibilities. Bulls are not trading back over the weekly 50% bear channel retracement mark and will look to turn 2330 turn into support next week. 

Support -204.5 -&gt; 191.7

Resistance- 245 -&gt; 254.7

As I had mentioned I do believe we are seeing the VIX being unwound before FOMC and next CPI. Its generally bad juju to have it over 30 before such events happen. With us clearly trading under the key 28.4 and now under 27 I will look for a the VIX to be near 23.6 to 24.7 before FOMC on Wednesday. 

10% challenge- 

Overall despite finishing green today (bless up tesla) today was not a great day for me. I was too biased bearish and I couldn’t get a read on the technical today. VOLD (difference of buy/ sell on NYSE) is one of my biggest indicators and biggest check boxes for entering a trade. Today until about 1145am VOLD was not supporting any sort of rallying. IT actually was showing that a huge sell off should have occurred. This also put me overly bearish, however, the charge was led by SPY and tech today and by mid day NYSE jumped on board finally. From there I still took every rejection (consolidation) at key levels as a short opportunity and ended up missing out on some good bull plays. 

Cant win them all and no ones perfect but I look forward to a good weekend to reset my head and trade better next week. This has been a pretty tough 3 days to trade in my opinion. Monday and Tuesday were great though thankfully. 

My Apple put was toasted at open but took a nice win on that Amazon earnings play at open to recoup most of the loss… apparently I shoulda gone even more OTM as one of the 80s puts on Amazon paid 1k%+ at open.

I have gotten a lot of questions of “how did you go from 6 out of 8 weeks being red to 8 green weeks in a row? “How is it even possible to go from losing that much to winning like this now?” 

The answer sadly was right in front of me the whole time… risk management. I am someone that preaches and preaches risk management and small gains till im blue in my server. However, I failed to practice what I preached. 

Lets take a look at the win % of July and August 71.76% vs. my current 84.16% win rate currently. Yes a 84.16% win rates impressive in my opinion but with my strategy I can and should be profitable with a 71.76% win rate? So why was I note profitable? Lets take a look at a few weeks of trades and its pretty easy to see why. 

Note- for those of you who question why I use excel to show my losses/ wins this is why cause I can analyze things in a way that TOS does not let me. 

Now what do you see? In terms of stop losses there were no stop losses. I thought I was smarter then the chart. I thought that I just got a bad bounce and it would come back to me. What I ended up doing was putting myself in such a whole that I couldn’t recover. 

For the week on the left had I closed stuff out at -20% I would have finished the week at +$1974 and on the right I would have closed the week at $1890. Same win rate… but completely different result… So not even changing the loss from a win BUT changing where I close out my loss (and more importantly accepting my loss at -20%) would immediately have turned two of those 6 week green (and actually would have turned every one of those 6 weeks green and even looking back from January to June I believe 90% of my weeks had I closed out at -20% on my losses… and not increased my win rate or anything else… I would have been profitable on every single week.). 

So when people ask me “what did you change?” “its impossible for someone to have 8 green weeks!” “its impossible for someone to recover like that!”

I say no its not… I say and I say this to 90% of people who blow their accounts up or have a green week go red… “where was your stop loss?”   
 

Risk management and mitigating our losses is about 100x more important then taking proifts. There are actually numerous strategies out there that can have 40-60% win rates BUT with proper stop losses can have extremely profitable results. 

There is a rule called the 10/20 rules… the goal should be 10% profits and we should use a HARD -20% stop loss. We can not think about it and we can not try to out smart it. This is another reason I stopped playing 0dte lottos as they would result in -90% losses I could recover. 

I will make this into a dedicated reddit post and mention a few other things later too but wanted to bring this up here too!

94,wallstreetbets,TheGoatBet,self.wallstreetbets,98,Inflation! Also known as corporate greed via price gouging!," 

Exxon Mobile recently revealed record gross (25%) and net (10.7%) profit margins for Q3 2022.

Q4 2020 was their lowest margins of all time at 17% gross and **-12.4%** net (yes negative net margin).

It's incredibly obvious that energy companies are not raising rates due to inflation but rather to price gouge consumers to make up for their lack of profit from Q4 2020 to Q3 2021.

But wait, it gets better! A metric called Free Cash Flow represents the amount of cash a business has on hand to pay dividends, interest to investors or repay creditors (or do anything else they want).

In Q4202 Exxon Mobile had **-$2.6B** in FCF. Today they have a positive $49.3B in FCF with $39.5B in long term debt (a $12.8B decline year over year).

So what does that mean? Exxon could pay off **all** of their long term debt and still have nearly $10 BILLION DOLLARS in the bank.

So just remember while nearly every human on Earth was struggling financially and emotionally during the pandemic... Exxon has been capitating from the ""Blame it on inflation"" excuse like **every other business** to achieve all time high profit margins which are currently up 46.3% since Dec 31, 2020.

When's the last time you got a 46% raise in 2 years?

But yeah ""inflation"" ...  

TLDR: record margin year, reversion to the mean, lower profit in future. Long poots.

0,wallstreetbets,JohnniePeters,self.wallstreetbets,24,Stock: CD Projekt Red (CPR) - from games like The Witcher and Cyberpunk,"CD Project Red (CDR). For those who don't know, this is a Polish game developer. Mainly known from The Witcher series and Cyberpunk 2077.

The Witcher 3 in particular was a huge success with over 40 million copies sold!

After a disastrous start of the game 'Cyberpunk 2077' in 2020, the stock has since gone into free fall and this was very deserved. The stock fell from €104,- in Dec. 2020 to €17,- on September 1, 2022. From this point on, the stock rose to €26,- today, and this was all due to the new announcements about 4 weeks ago.

But the game Cyberpunk has also made a big comeback. It broke record after record in recent weeks and months and has already sold more than 20 million times. There will also be a free DLC (Downloadable Content) for this game in 2023.

Why I am very bullish on this stock:

\* The Witcher 3 was a huge success, however only 10% of players have also played The Witcher 1, which came out in 2007. I expect the upcoming remake (Canis Majoris) to be widely sold among fans of The Witcher 3, but also to new players.

\* Due to the enormous success of The Witcher 3, it is very likely that the new 3-part series of games (Polaris) will sell extremely well. In addition, all 3 games in that series will be released within 6 years, at least that is the intention and realistically this can be very likely (The games are made in Unreal Engine 5)

\* The new standalone of The Witcher (Sirius) will undoubtedly reach the hardcore fans, but may also attract new fans who are more focused on multiplayer.

\* Completely new IP! (Hadar) I expect a huge hype. A hype that will be fulfilled. One has learned from the Cyberpunk release is my view. And the strong comeback of Cyberpunk 2077 seems to restore buyer confidence.

\* The new Cyberpunk (Orion) game. Because the first game (Cyberpunk 2077) has made a strong comeback, and has even completely silenced all criticism from 2 years ago, this game will be sold enormously. A new fan base has been tapped, because in essence it is a completely different world than the one of The Witcher. This game will also be developed in Unreal Engine 5 and it is expected that the controls of vehicles in particular will feel much more real and smoother. Cyberpunk's current sales and the 180-degree twisted sentiment surrounding that game portend that Orion has a grandiose future.

Overall, I believe the price of this stock is deeply undervalued. No guarantees.

I don’t have a single stock. However, on monday it will be the first thing I’m going to do.

7,wallstreetbets,predictany007,self.wallstreetbets,20,Elon Musk’s first day owning Twitter leads to havoc and a possible hoax about layoffs,"On Elon Musk’s first day in control of Twitter, a person who walked out of the company’s San Francisco headquarters and identified themselves as a data engineer there said they were just laid off. CNBC was not able to immediately verify the identity of that person and one other who made a similar claim.

One employee at Twitter, awaiting information about layoffs or projects, told CNBC they were in the dark for the most part. Musk was meeting with relatively low-ranking engineering managers, this person noted —a welcome gesture to some. Press reports before the deal closed said that Musk had planned cuts as deep as 75% of headcount.

Twitter did not respond to repeated requests for comment about layoffs.

Musk finally took over the company on Thursday, ending a months-long legal saga. The billionaire Tesla and SpaceX CEO initially agreed to buy the company for $44 billion, but soon after tried to get out of the deal because he claimed Twitter was not forthcoming enough about spam accounts on the platform. Twitter has denied that and went to court to try to get Musk to complete the deal.

Prior to the original trial date earlier this month, Musk agreed once again to close the deal. The judge gave Musk until Friday at 5 p.m. to close the deal, or else set a new trial date.

On Thursday, several top executives departed the company, including CEO Parag Agrawal and CFO Ned Segal, CNBC’s David Faber reported. Twitter’s head of legal policy, trust and safety Vijaya Gadde was also fired.

Listen to me instead. An elder millennial that gets triggered by misinformation all day long and also thinks I know better. (sometimes it's even true) Also, may or may not be regarded. You tell me. 

Here's what I see:

\&gt;""it looks worse than roblox / vr chat"" 

\&gt;""Facebook is dying""

\&gt;""bring back myspace""

First of all, shut the fuck up. Just stop. Please. It hurts my head. If it was true, that would be fine. But like I said I my autism gets triggered by dumbness. 

WHY has Facebook/META thrown nearly 100 billion at this? (with a revenue of 27 billion per quarter, they have the money)

Facebook is the ONLY multi-modal social media company in the USA. It has a marketplace, local community groups, videos (50% of all facebook traffic is watching videos) not to mention Insta, whatsapp. You can do almost anything on it. Run a business. Chat with your mom. See what your friends are doing. Rent a boat. Harass women with pics of your extremely small penis. Whatever you want! (don't do the last one bro. Just don't.)

So WHY? 

It's a hardware platform, that you cannot access on a normal PC. Only on a META VR headset (potentially) 

You think the graphics look bad? That's like blaming youtube for 480p video. Don't blame youtube. Blame the creator for having a shitty camera. Metaverse is the platform. Not the video. It's a new platform that has tools to do whatever you want. AR or VR both in one.

Now just imagine this, if you can. Tell your wife to hop off her boyfriend's dick, pull both of them over, and try to imagine with me. 

Your favorite youtube/twitch livestreamer? Don't watch them anymore. VR with them. Walk in their room as they talk to you. Sit at their desk. You're not behind a screen anymore. You're in the room. Even a prerecorded youtube video can work this way. Or do it live.

You want to see that Ye redemption concert tour but the tickets are $5,000? Attend in VR. Walk around, live. The performer doesn't need a headset. Just you. Interact with other VR people at the concert (or not). See their facial expressions. Dance with them. Switch your headset over to AR, go to the fridge, get a drink, check your texts, reply to an email, and then head back into the concert. All using the headset. Buy merch at the shop, which has an AR eshop overlay. Easy. This can be done with 3d camera arrays. Even a basic iphone can LIDAR scan a bedroom in 5 minutes. Apple ahead of the game as always. A highly accurate (to the 1/16"" accuracy) venue model can be recreated in a single day using current technology, like the Leica BLK360 scanner. That's your metaverse. It's whatever you want. 

You can't attend your best friends wedding? Attend in VR metaverse platform. The normal attendees will just see you on a screen (or not at all), they don't need headsets. But you can walk around, see the moment, while not being too invasive. To them, you're just on an ipad somewhere. Maybe there's a few 360 cameras around. Some LIDAR scanners to record the venue (or the venue provides this). You're not intrusive, but you can experience it. 

Want to buy a puppy on FB marketplace? See it in VR. Live. Confirm it's not a scam. Send the money through Facebook even, with buyer protection.

Onlyfans - see your favorite porn model from every angle. Walk around. Jack off in the privacy of your home. Squirt some e-jizz all over his/her face. or not. I'm not the boss of you.

The possibilities here are endless. This hasn't even mentioned the work from home benefits yet. This is still 5-10 years down the road. But it is coming. Reality and the digital world WILL mix together more and more over time. Unless the apocalypse gets us first ofc. And META has a huge head start in technology hardware and software tools (not software environment))

So. That's why you're all dumb for comparing it to VR chat. Thanks for coming to my ted talk.

I sold my calls yesterday, but I plan on going back in next week on Jan 100c contracts.

Volume rises as fears over covid grow. Notice how panic selling is associated with spikes in volume. 2. Panic buying can also cause panic selling. It's not unusual to get your highest volume days where the price is flat. I suspect this is because people are disagreeing about how to interpret the news. My guess is that in February, hockey puck candles with large volume represent uncertainty. I think the volume represents this process happening over and over:

1. Someone bearish because of COVID sells
2. Someone who thinks covid isn't a big deal buys because ""COVID isn't a big deal, and the market will bounce back"".
3. Someone who was bearish and missed their chance to sell at this price level finally caves and sells their shares
4. Someone who thinks covid is a big deal, and therefore counts on government intervention buys
5. Cycle back to the bear selling until closing.
6. In the end, you have a reason for both bulls and bears to buy and sell to each other, and you get a huge spike in volume
7. Candles flatten out and the volume starts to fall, I suspect because bulls and bears have largely positioned themselves already. There's no reason for either group to buy or sell at this point.
8. Volume picks up as the pandemic reveals itself to a threat to the economy.
9. The end of the COVID market panic winds down as volume falls.",0.67,2,0,2,question,2022-10-28T20:13:50Z,yfuin8,t3

* “Sometimes in-line results are most exciting,” wrote JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee in a note on Friday.

Apple stock rose over 7% on Friday after reporting September quarter earnings that modestly beat expectations on revenue and profit and showed global demand for its premium hardware remains high.

If it holds until the close, it’ll be the best day for Apple shares since April 2020. Apple was the second-best-performing stock in the Dow Jones behind Intel on Friday.

The surge comes after a mixed week of Big Tech earnings, in which Meta and Alphabet

showed signs of weakness caused by macroeconomic conditions hurting the digital ad market. Alphabet rose less than 3% and Meta was up less than 1%.on Friday. Both took big hits earlier in the week.

Amazon fell 9% on Friday after giving weak guidance for the holiday quarter.

Although Apple signaled some slowing growth in the current quarter, and weakness in its profitable service business, analysts were generally positive about the company’s results.

“The New York Stock Exchange hereby notifies the SEC of its intention to remove the entire class of the stated securities from listing and registration on the Exchange at the opening of business on November 08, 2022, pursuant to the provisions of Rule 12d2-2 (a),” the filing reads.

Industry participants know this line item as the ""missing barrels"" row. Most years this makes up only a small part of the overall supply/demand picture, but recently this number has been growing to record proportions of the overall report. Here's a quote from Bloomberg's ""Elements"" newsletter explaining the scale of these ghost barrels in more detail.

""Typically, the adjustment factor is relatively small, perhaps 1% of  total demand. But earlier this week, the US Energy Information  Administration, a government agency, said it couldn't properly identify a  record 2.26 million barrels per day of oil -- equivalent to nearly 11%  of the country's consumption. To put the number into perspective, if the  EIA ""adjustment"" line was a country, it would roughly equal  the daily  oil consumption of Germany."" --*Javier Blas; Bloomberg Elements*

The problem began growing in 2016 when the US lifted oil export restrictions and domestic production began to increase significantly. It has led to baseless conspiracy theories that the EIA has become a political tool for helping the white house. I receive many of the EIA reports directly to my email, and I can tell you that they put together the most comprehensive regional/ national energy statistics in the world. The missing barrels problem, however, seems to be growing out of control and needs to be quickly addressed.

""In July, the most recent month available, the adjustment factor climbed  to 1.1 million barrels -- or about 10 times the average from 1973 to  2021."" --*Javier Blas; Bloomberg Elements*",0.63,2,0,2,question,2022-10-28T18:20:22Z,yfqzwb,t3

87,wallstreetbets,Sunsmiling,self.wallstreetbets,10,Exxon's record-smashing Q3 profit nearly matches Apple's," 

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp on Friday smashed expectations as soaring energy prices fuelled a record-breaking quarterly profit, nearly matching that of tech giant Apple.

Its $19.66 billion third-quarter net profit far exceeded recently raised Wall Street forecasts as sky-rocketing natural gas and high oil prices put its earnings within reach of Apple's $20.7 billion net for the same period.

As recently as 2013, Exxon ranked as the largest publicly traded U.S. company by market value - a position now held by Apple.

Oil company profits have soared this year as rising demand and an under-supplied energy market collided with Western sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. U.S. exports of gas and oil to Europe have jumped and promise to set all-time profit records for the industry.

The top U.S. oil producer reported a per share profit of $4.68, exceeding Wall Street's $3.89 consensus view, on a huge jump in natural gas earnings, continued high oil prices and strong fuel sales.

Exxon, which led record gains by the five producers known as oil majors in the prior quarter, pulled far ahead of peers Shell and TotalEnergies with third-quarter profits almost twice as big. Its gains were aided by its highly criticized decision to double down on fossil fuels as European competitors shifted to renewables.

""Our investments over the past five years, including through the lows of the pandemic, are really driving our results today,"" Chief Financial Officer Kathryn Mikells told Reuters.

Exxon banked $43 billion in the first nine months of this year, 19% more than in the same period of 2008, when oil prices traded at a record level of $140 per barrel.

The company spent $5.73 billion on new oil and gas projects last quarter, up 24% from a year ago, and remains on track to hit an investment target of $21 billion to $24 billion this year, she said.

Rising profits have renewed calls by U.S. President Joe Biden for companies to invest the windfall profits from this year's energy price runup in production rather than buy back their own shares.

Exxon will maintain its $30 billion share buyback program through 2023 while increasing dividends, Mikells said. On Friday, it declared a fourth-quarter per share dividend of 91 cents, up 3 cents, and will pay $15 billion to shareholders this year.

Investors this week pushed up Exxon shares to a record intraday high of $109.58 as oil prices traded above $96 per barrel.

In the third quarter, U.S. natural gas prices averaged $7.95 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), up 10% from the second quarter. Brent prices eased to $98 per barrel in the same period, from an average of $109 between April and June.

Exxon said its oil and gas production from the Permian Basin is near 560,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed), a record. That is up 11% or 50,000 barrels per day from a year ago.

Results were helped by an almost 100,000 boed increase over the previous quarter in Guyana, where Exxon leads a consortium responsible for all output in the South American nation.

But output was hit by its withdrawal from Russia, where it abandoned more than $4 billion in assets and a 220,000 boed project following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. Exxon said its assets were expropriated.

As a result, the company reduced its production forecast for the year by about 100,000 barrels per day.

""We are going to end up at about 3.7 million barrels a day for the full year,"" Mikells said, down from a 3.8 million goal set in February.",0.75,6,0,6,question,2022-10-28T15:48:15Z,yfna3y,t3

 Its shares are down 77.1% year-to-date and 89.3% below their July 2021 all-time highs.
 Stocks are attractive after their big drop this year.
 It's been a tough year for Roku, whose shares have lost more than two-thirds of their value as macroeconomic issues worsen, including rising interest rates, rising inflation and concerns about a potential recession. .
 The ad-heavy streaming platform and hardware provider, which was one of the notable winners during the pandemic, has also been weighed down by deteriorating fundamentals, including slowing digital ad spending, the supply chain, as well as increased competition from other streaming companies.
 After hitting an all-time high of $490.76 in July 2021, Roku shares, which have lost 77.1% so far this year, fell rapidly to hit a low of $47.27 on Oct. 24.  Since then, Roku shares have staged a modest rally, closing Thursday at $52.27, although they remain about 90% below their all-time highs.
 At current levels, the San Jose, California-based streaming device maker's market capitalization stands at $7.2 billion, up from $60 billion when it peaked.
 Roku's stock has become very attractive after falling this year, given its impressive growth in active accounts and improved monetization from existing and new users.
 The next major catalyst is expected to come when Roku releases its third-quarter results after the US market closes on Wednesday, November 2.",0.53,1,0,1,question,2022-10-28T15:41:03Z,yfn4l8,t3

# Why is this gobbledygook relevant?

The Federal Reserve creates money and uses it to buy bonds. They do this to push interest rates down and to put more money into the economy. Low rates mean people can borrow more, spend more, and afford higher prices. More spending and higher prices mean people feel rich, and businesses hire new employees.

But, if prices rise too quickly or people borrow too much, the Fed does the opposite. It sells the bonds it has and then destroys the money it receives. These sales push interest rates up and take money out of the economy. Higher rates mean people can't borrow or spend as much and must pay lower prices. It makes people feel poorer than before, stops them from being able to spend as much, and makes businesses trim employment.

In addition to this, the Fed borrows and lends to banks. If a bank doesn't have enough money for a day or two, it can borrow from the Fed. If it has too much, it can lend to the Fed. A group of people who work for the Fed, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), decide the interest rate that the Fed will pay for, or demand of, these short-term loans.

The Fed does these because they believe in two objectives: first, a low and stable inflation rate is good for the economy, and second, that minimising unemployment is desirable.

# FAQs

**Why do you look at weekly average balance sheet data instead of the Wednesday level?**

It takes time for asset settlement to occur. The holdings on any given day will fluctuate wildly—especially given that the Fed owns almost $9trn of assets. The weekly average is smoother and more indicative of the monetary policy trend.

Wolf Speed semiconductor reported Q3 earnings on Wednesday and guided below consensus for Q4 estimates. Their cut for estimates potentially ends their 50% year-over-year growth prospects for the coming quarters. Their rival $ON Semi will report on October, 31st. $ON Semi has been one of the best-performing semiconductor stocks of the year only falling a mere 3.5% before the Wolf Speed's report and Wolf Speed was relatively outperforming as well until falling nearly 20% on Thursday. Both these companies are heavily specialized in the automotive industry for EVs and have enjoyed high demand. But now it seems the industry is starting to show cracks after Wolf Speed's cut. The most interesting phenomenon about On Semi is the OTM puts for January 20, 2023, which show over 17,000 bought for the strike of 30$ and 15,000 bought for the strike of $50. 

No one knows for certain about the future of these 2 companies but there is a serious risk of ON Semi-being butchered for cutting guidance.",0.5,0,0,0,question,2022-10-28T14:29:37Z,yfln6q,t3

14,wallstreetbets,Guilty-Ham,self.wallstreetbets,24,‘Dramatic increase.’ Foreclosure filings are up more than 150%. Here’s what that tells us about the housing market,"The number of foreclosure starts — which is when the first public foreclosure notice happens — is up 219% since the start of the year, according to real estate data analytics firm ATTOM Data Solutions’ midyear 2022 U.S. foreclosure market report. What’s more, the number of properties that had foreclosure filings (this number includes foreclosure starts) is up 153% from the same time period last year. 

Fully 96% of major metro areas saw an annual increase in foreclosure filings, with foreclosure rates highest in Illinois, New Jersey and Ohio. And when it comes to the number of foreclosure starts, California topped the list, followed by Florida, Tennessee, Illinois and Ohio.

“Foreclosure activity across the United States continued its slow, steady climb back to pre-pandemic levels in the first half of 2022,” says Rick Sharga, executive vice president of market intelligence at ATTOM. “While overall foreclosure activity is still running significantly below historic averages, the dramatic increase in foreclosure starts suggests that we may be back to normal levels by sometime in early 2023,” says Sharga. (See the lowest mortgage rates you can get here.)
What does this uptick in foreclosures mean for the housing market?

Foreclosures are shooting up as the various foreclosure moratoriums that kept people in their homes during the worst of the pandemic’s economic disruptions have now ended, explains Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com. That said, they are shooting up from extremely low levels, she adds — noting that even after the sharp increase in foreclosure activity observed in the first half of 2022, we’re still not back to 2019’s low pre-pandemic mid-year total.

“Much like the sharp turnaround in housing inventory that we’ve observed in the number of for-sale homes recently, when the market has tilted in one direction very extremely, we see huge percentage increases when the trends shift back in a different direction, even though in many aspects what we’re witnessing is just a return to something resembling what was once normal,” says Hale.

Indeed, “it’s important to note that many of the foreclosure starts we’re seeing today — in fact, much of the overall foreclosure activity we’re seeing right now is on loans that were either already in foreclosure or were more than 120 days delinquent prior to the pandemic,” says Sharga. Indeed, many of these loans were protected by the foreclosure moratorium put in place by the government during the pandemic — therefore just halting the inevitable by a couple of years. Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate says, “Foreclosure activity is returning to normal levels after being artificially depressed by pandemic-induced payment relief programs and extended foreclosure moratoriums. In a historical context, foreclosures are still very low.”

And while these foreclosure numbers sound dramatic, Holden Lewis, home and mortgage expert at NerdWallet, says it’s not enough to make a dent in the housing market or the overall economy. “Even a healthy housing market has foreclosures, and this pace is nothing to worry about,” says Lewis.
What does this mean for buyers?

While foreclosures remain unfortunate for the owners of those homes, for shoppers who have been frustrated by the lack of homes for sale in their budget, the increase in foreclosures could bring additional options, says Hale. “But much like the increases we see in for-sale housing inventory, it’s just the first step. We would need to see many more months of these increases before home shoppers will feel like they have an abundance of homes to choose from,” says Hale. source without paywall: https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marketwatch.com%2Fpicks%2Fdramatic-increase-foreclosure-filings-are-up-more-than-150-heres-what-that-tells-us-about-the-housing-market-01659181360",0.85,12,0,12,news,2022-11-03T10:01:19Z,ykvrzo,t3

* It takes 9-12 months for rate hikes to be felt and 12-18 months for the maximum effect. It makes sense to slow down the current pace given we are only eight months past the first rate hike.
* Fed will want slower total and core inflation, pullbacks in house prices and rents, slower wage growth, lower job openings, and likely an increase in the unemployment rate prior to a real pivot.
* Fed is also concerned about the upcoming winter heating season that may cause another spike in energy prices.
* Rate hikes are likely to continue into 2023 in smaller increments.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%. (Stats as of 2022-10-28)",0.79,8,0,8,dd,2022-11-03T04:30:07Z,ykpuun,t3

Does that mean earnings is likely going be bad?  As they could of announced this “somewhat” good news on earnings, but decided to issues the news a day prior to earnings.

The specific company I am talking about is Virgin Galactic SPCE.  Earnings is tomorrow and while they have no earnings the expectation is that their spaceship fleet is ready to fly.  However might get delayed.

Today they provided a update that they have found suppliers for their next generation fleet.

Listening through the meeting and listening it through it again, I do sense a bit dovishness in his speech. More so than I had originally anticipated looking at the underlying economic data. Caveat to that is it really involves one thing, the rate of increase, not overall Fed Fund rate increase. On the latter, it looks like he's taking that 25 bps and going to push it towards the Feb meeting. I'm overall still bearish for the time being. 

The rate hike that I initially anticipated would be 75 bps for December. It's looking highly more likely that'll it'll be 50 bps. That said, it's looking way more likely that Feb will be 50 bps increase as well in 2023 and will hold it there. That'll push it towards the 4.75%-5% range.

That said, if economic data doesn't improve halfway through this month going past December, I'm thinking they'll keep pushing rates into Q2 2023 most likely in 25 bps range pushing it over the 5% Fed fund rate point.

Powell agreed there wil at some point be a time to slow rate… however, he confirmed that time is not now and it would be pre-mature… The question that will remain now is was this some unbelievably wild over reaction to what JPOW said or did we just witness the top get put in? There is a case to be made for both that’s for sure.

I took the 389C overnight and that was looking rough for a really long time this morning. Thankfully with the rogue pump before FOMC and then the 2pm pump that was expected I exited for a pretty decent win. Not the best exit but when its moving like that it’s the best you can do for sure. 

That pump also allowed me as expected to exit my now 5dte 386C too for almost 20% win.

I did follow my plan of the 234pm calls. I entered and hit 30% profits pretty much instantly… unfortunately that was where the music stopped playing for me. I fully expected based on movement that we were going to see a really big bullish break out on SPY after the 230 presser as historically has happened. However, it dumped pretty much immediately after I entered. I never saw green again and there was no sense to average down or try to do anything silly. 

If you were okay with small profits it did hit, however, if you weren’t fast it turned into a loss.

Someone asked me last night “why don’t you present a bearish case too?” well until today there wasn’t really a reason to present one. What do I mean by that? Well we had been holding this red bull channel for over 3 weeks now. There was little reason to bet against that until we saw like now a breakdown of that support. 

With SPY now breaking through that green channel support of 378.1 and not only that it also rejected the attempted break through of 388.6 resistance I do favor a bearish case now. With the blue resistance line and red bull channel support line there was also a rising wedge formed that has now broken. 

From here we look at our key levels which will be that 378.1 resistance level. If SPY can break back through there and close over that level tomorrow there actually could be a case made that today was some massive over reaction and we are going to see a reversion to mean break to the upside 385 range tomorrow. However, if we back test and reject 378.1 that is even more confirmation of downside to come. 

If you remember since last CPI the media was screaming a fed pivot and a fed slowing of rate hikes. Overall JPOW effectively just said that is NOT happening right now but in the future will happen. With that narrative now squashed where are we going to go next? The next thing on the Agenda is CPI on November 10th which so far we still do not have a consensus on core or CPI yet. However, monthly CPI is consensus of 0.7 which would be a 0.3% rise over previous MoM. I expect that CPI to release soon and I expect that could absolutely move the markets. 

Key support- 374.6 -&gt; 370.5 -&gt; 365

Key resistance- 378.1 -&gt; 379.9 -&gt; 384.1 -&gt; 388.6

Futures does not look any better then SPY and has broken through the red bull channel support also and landed at 3760 support. This will be the next support that bears what to try to take out. Bulls will look to get this back over 3865 by EOW if they want to remain bullish going forward. 

One major bearish thing we can take away here is that this week effectively was a daily 100ema rejection and now huge break down through daily 8 and 20ema. The bearish case is rising in strength. 

Key support- 3705 -&gt; 3675 -&gt; 3585

Key resistance- 3800 -&gt; 3865 -&gt; 3925

Apple actually was the last domino to fall today and even more interestingly about Apple it has officially broken through the bottom from Friday. That huge green day that Apple had on Friday is now completely gone and then some. 

With this bull channel now broken we are looking at downside obviously now too. It is hard to tell in this picture because if I zoomed out too far it would be hard to see the candles but we are actually seeing quite a bit of red. Looking at the daily you can see that 150.6 is the KEY pivot level of bullish vs. bearish and we are seeing a pretty aggressive rejection of the daily 100 and 200ema which I mentioned earlier would take a few trading days to play out. 

Key support- 144.7 -&gt; 141.1 -&gt; 138.2 

Key resistance- 149.2 -&gt; 150.6 -&gt; 153.4 -&gt; 155.4

They really did massacre my girl Tesla today. I was actually impressively bullish on tesla with that closure over key 230 and the candle body over the daily 20ema which fully closing over the daily 8ema. However, we just saw a pretty massive rejection of the daily 20ema today and closure just above key support at 214.9. 

Key support- 214.9 -&gt; 210 -&gt; 205.6

Key resistance- 219.4 -&gt; 225.8 -&gt; 229.9

What would a -2.5% red day on SPY be without the VIX closing barely green at 0.12%... Well I had imagined they were unwinding the VIX for FOMC and especially for CPI next week, however, I would have expected to see a reaction on the VIX especially with this dump. There is clearly still fear and unknown in this market thanks to JPOW today, however, the VIX didn’t really react. Will it react tomorrow? Or is this going to end up being a straight volume dump with VIX once again being detached? 

Daily log- 

Well I am going to start doing these a little differently! I am going to start a 2.5k 10% take profit/ 20% stop loss challenge. So EOD you will see me post my daily log and post results of a 2.55k challenge. I will probably end up making a separate post for the 2.5k challenge also. For me usually my first trade of the day is my best trade so I will utilize my first entry for the trade. I will use the full $2500 per trade (well as close as I can) and I will update this via Excel like my normal port. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1g4jz5ebqlx91.png?width=828&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05a2491de9d015a29655f9088fa96de3697abc0f

I will start the challenge tomorrow just going to move a few things around in my accounts. Now the thing with this is that it is NOT about full porting… that’s absolutely not what im doing this for and $5000 is not a full port for me. What I am doing instead is hoping to show you guys whether its $500, $1000, $2500, $10,000, etc. etc. If you have proper strategy and risk management and take small profits those small profits will add up over time. This is to show you compound growth. Yes one loss of 20% does set you back two 10% wins, but if you continue to trade the $2,500 it adds up and recovers fairly quickly. 

This is not a full port as I said… I will be utilizing $2,500 PER TRADE so as you see above the starting “balance” is $2,500 but that’s not all that is in there. In the future I may do another one of just one trade a day starting with like $5,000 or something in the account and attempt to grow that… the same premise remains though that as long as you maintain a good strategy one loss really only takes 2-3 trades to over come. With premiums being so ridiculous right now it’s a little hard to use less then $2,500 and even some days $2,500 will be a stretch but like I said it will be as close to $2,500 as it can be. 

I will continue to trade normally in my other account doing day traders/ scalps and of course my level to levels.

Not my best day but not my worse day. The important lesson today was no matter how highly probable a trade is… it can ALWAYS go against you and not only that… it is only a high probability trade if we remember to take profits. These trades that are the “big hitters” have to be lotto size and you have to understand that as you see above there is a chance it goes straight to zero.

11,wallstreetbets,Annual_Equipment_370,self.wallstreetbets,46,I'm pivoting,"Wow, I'm just gonna cash out, delete my brokerage app and forget about fucking stocks forever.  
This week I've accurately used my 3 pre-PDT trades to gain $500 and get rid of this status right before today's shitstorm. I was sitting in cash, 25.2k, just waiting for the FOMC, playing chess and thinking that I'm probably done for today unless market chooses a clear direction after the meeting. Then I see a notification on my phone. YOUR POSITION MAY BE LIQUIDATED.   


wat?  


I opened the app and saw that I'm fucking shorting SQQQ at 52.00 and it's 53.50 now. I forgot to cancel one of the stop orders and went short on margin. I freaked out, tried to cancel the trade via app support and set a buy order at 52.11. Eventually the position was closed at this price and I only lost like $50 on that. And a shitload on neurones.  


After I closed the position, I had a chat with my gf about all the situation, we freaked out, but I felt lucky to escape a potential infinite loss.   


So, happy end, huh? I've evaded PDT status by doing two good trades and dodged this short margin position liquidation.  


Well, after some time I saw a bunch of enormous green dicks on SQQQ chart, realised that market has decided to finally dump and I still can join the trend, bought some SQQQ at 56.00, with default stop loss at 55.00 and profit taker at 57.00. Right after my order was filled, the stonk started to tank. I felt stressed af. It was too much for today and just wanted to exit the trade, fuck off and chill till tomorrow. Instead of closing it with minimal loss, I just watched SQQQ dropped to 55, lost $500, received PDT status, then in half an hour SQQQ jumped to 58, and to 59 in another half an hour. So if I haven't initialised the trade, I would've been +$450 today. If I've sold at a $100 loss, I'd still be fine. If I've managed my stop loss according to volatility, I would've been + extra $1k at close.  


Instead, I'm banned from trading for 90 days. I just watch the market rapidly tanking, feel even more FOMO and self-hatred for being stupid enough to do some emotional trades after such a day and risking my 25k PDT limit. I can't deposit extra money to the account, because my Ukrainian bank doesn't allow me to send USD abroad due to war time restrictions.  


I was waiting for this fucking FOMC and upcoming 52w lows during this whole bullshit rally month, hoping to ride the SQQQ till SPY @ 360. Now I'm fucked, my plan is fucked, finances are fucked. Total loss: $5k. Not as devastating as some of you apes have, but painful enough, and I won't be able to manage this loss in the next 90 days, maybe never, I just feel sick from these fucking candles. Maybe I'll just buy virgin IVW in Feb and maybe will be able to cover my losses in 5 years with the help of cOmPoUnD iNtErEsT. If we won't die in fucking great nuclear war recession till then.

Also, thanks to JPOW I was able to mitigate my losses on my ABNB FD 90 puts.  
I happily sold for only a 35% loss on those; but made 50% on my 100 P FD play (around 7K in profit).

# Final Comment

&amp;#x200B;

AMC is a heavily indebted company; the leverage is unsustainable, and the company is struggling to have positive net income. Its Cash Burning Rate is at 2.56, meaning its spending 2.5 times more its cash availability, giving the company a life expectancy of 30 moths with its current cash &amp; cash equivalents. It will need to cash in accounts receivables to extend more its life expectancy.

Income quality dropped drastically since 2018, it means that total earnings do not correspond to the actual cash intake from its operations.

Cash Ration indicate that the company will struggle to pay its current liabilities with its current cash.

Without  a drastic change in its fundamentals, the company is in high risk.

It is advisable to keep an eye on the Company operations and Management Action and evaluate possible adjustments for the final pricing without any changes in trends, the company is destined to die.

IMO they will get interest rates close to core inflation and see how much it slows down inflation. Then they may increase it further for a full on recession to bring prices down by killing the economy. 


If core inflation does start going down through Q4 and early 2023, we will see slower rate increases. If stays high, we're going to 6% very fast.

75,wallstreetbets,predictany007,self.wallstreetbets,12,Fed approves 0.75-point hike to take rates to highest since 2008 and hints at change in policy ahead,"The Federal Reserve on Wednesday approved a fourth consecutive three-quarter point interest rate increase and signaled a potential change in how it will approach monetary policy to bring down inflation.

In a well-telegraphed move that markets had been expecting for weeks, the central bank raised its short-term borrowing rate by 0.75 percentage point to a target range of 3.75%-4%, the highest level since January 2008.

The move continued the most aggressive pace of monetary policy tightening since the early 1980s, the last time inflation ran this high.

Along with anticipating the rate hike, markets also had been looking for language indicating that this could be the last 0.75-point, or 75 basis point, move. Specifically, some Fed officials along with Wall Street economists and strategists in recent weeks had talked of a “step-down” in policy that could see a rate increase of half a point at the December meeting and then a few smaller hikes in 2023.

That language was not overt in the post-meeting statement from the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, though there was a tweak that could point to an adjustment in policy.

This week’s statement expanded on previous language simply declaring that “ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate.“

The new language read: “The Committee anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time.“

The statement reiterated that policy changes “will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.“

Markets will look to Chairman Jerome Powell’s news conference at 2:30 p.m. for more clarity on whether the Fed thinks it can implement less restrictive policy that would include a less dramatic level of rate hikes to achieve its inflation goals.

Along with the tweak in the statement, the FOMC again categorized growth in spending and production as “modest” and noted that “job gains have been robust in recent months” while inflation is “elevated.” The statement also reiterated language that the committee is “highly attentive to inflation risks.“

The rate increase comes as recent inflation readings show prices remain near 40-year highs. A historically tight jobs market in which there are nearly two openings for every unemployed worker is pushing up wages, a trend the Fed is seeking to head off as it tightens money supply.

Concerns are rising that the Fed, in its efforts to bring down the cost of living, also will pull the economy into recession. Powell has said he still sees a path to a “soft landing” in which there is not a severe contraction, but the U.S. economy this year has shown virtually no growth even as the full impact from the rate hikes has yet to kick in.

At the same time, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure showed the cost of living rose 6.2% in September from a year ago – 5.1% even excluding food and energy costs. GDP declined in both the first and second quarters, meeting a common definition of recession, though it rebounded to 2.6% in the third quarter largely because of an unusual rise in exports. At the same time, housing prices have plunged as 30-year mortgage rates have soared past 7% in recent days.

On Wall Street, markets have been rallying in anticipation that the Fed soon might start to ease back as worries grow over the longer-term impact of higher rates.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained more than 13% over the past month, in part because of an earnings season that wasn’t as bad as feared but also amid growing hopes for a recalibration of Fed policy. Treasury yields also have come off their highest levels since the early days of the financial crisis, though they remain elevated. The benchmark 10-year note most recently was around 4.04%.

There is little if any expectation that the rate hikes will halt anytime soon, so the anticipation is just on a slower pace. Futures traders are pricing a near coin-flip chance of a half-point increase in December, against another three-quarter point move.

Current market pricing also indicates the fed funds rate will top out near 5% before the rate hikes cease.

The fed funds rate sets the level that banks charge each other for overnight loans, but spills over into multiple other consumer debt instruments such as adjustable-rate mortgages, auto loans and credit cards.

Listen, Zuck MIGHT be an absolute regard and Meta MIGHT be the downfall of his company, but I hardly believe that’s the case. Take VR-chat for example, I have seen lots of people compare meta with vr-chat pointing out that there already is an existing product that currently, beats meta in regards to graphics and so on. But meta was and isnt meant to be like vr-chat. Vr-chat didnt change gaming or gaming trends in basically any shape or form. We still use our systems and most of us would never switch to vr when we have pc and other standard gaming consoles. So why would meta try to create an already existing product, which has proven to not be very successfull? Well I think the answer is simple, they’re not doing that. The massive spending everyone is constantly reffering to is obviously not spent on the graphics or how it ”looks”, but the engine and the software, that currently (as shown by vr-chat), is very underdeveloped. The product isnt and was never meant to be operational or used right now, but everyone seems to think that because of the massive spending, bad graphics and an unfinished product, meta is DOOMED. I believe that there is profound potential in the metaverse because of the massive spendings, not the other way around. People want groundbreaking technology that potentially could represent reality, but act suprised when it turns out the cost of such a system to be built, is massive. Regarded sheep mindset.

Rates in have to be above the rate of inflation. 

For example, if you get a mortgage at current rates, about 7% and the rate of inflation is at 8.1%, you are borrowing money at a rate that is lower than inflation, which is not considered restrictive, or that it is stiil cheaper to borrow vs the appreciation of a commodity or asset.

The dilemma that jpow faces, is the time lag theory, which states that for each rate hike, it takes at minimum 6 months for for it to effect in the economy. The totality of  the effects of the rate hikes will really not be known until mid 2023. So no one really knows what the actual effects of hikes will do.

&amp;#x200B;

All apple products are pricey things, including the iPhone, mac, iPad and everything.

Yes they are excellent products with absolutely outstanding performances compared to other products out in the market. Still, yet a LOT of people who buy apple products can save a fortune by picking other products other than the standard MacBook or the iPhone. But yet they have so much market monopoly going on all over the world with such products that will normally be considered quite expensive, to the extent this is almost baffling

&amp;#x200B;

Apple grew AGAIN in the latest quarter
(While all the other major companies mostly had an earnings shock) and I personally think this can only be explained by ""People paying for apple products again and again."" If apple was a growing company aspiring to eat up a lot of the marketplace in the future then the reason for their growth would be pretty obvious. But they're not. It's not like they're starting to insert ads within the ios to increase their revenue. Their one and only source of profit is (mostly) their Apple products. Phones, Laptops, and Tablets that are more than outstanding in quality but also have a significantly higher price tag compared to other products.

It's making people buy the same iPhone again and more (well, not the same but you can still work longer with your previous iPhone.). I don't think Apple would be able to grow this much if people only bought a single iPhone to replace their previous iPhone every three years when their iPhone finally dies.  For some reason they're making the same people buy so much apple products again although their extremely high price tag. Something like buying another iPhone in a shorter span. Or buying other Apple products as well after purchasing your iPhone. Adding a new Macbook in your shopping cart although your previous one is still good.

Seems like people LOVE the iPhone. Yes it's a cult, it's almost something like a new religion

&amp;#x200B;

They don't really have a lot of new customers out there to purchase their first iPhone. Yet the company is still GROWING. A LOT

&amp;#x200B;

Is it the marketing? Is it because of product quality?

&amp;#x200B;

How is the company still GROWING?

35,wallstreetbets,predictany007,self.wallstreetbets,16,Amazon has exited the trillion-dollar club. Sell-off pushes market cap below $1 trillion for first time since April 2020," 

* Amazon’s stock closed down Tuesday for a fifth straight day, falling to the lowest since April 2020.
* Last week the company projected sales in the holiday quarter would be far below expectations.
* The stock dropped 5.9% to $96.79.
* Amazon has exited the trillion-dollar club.

Shares of the e-retailer plunged 5.9% on Tuesday, falling for a fifth straight day and closing at their lowest since April 2020. The sell-off has erased almost all of the stock’s pandemic surge.

Investors continued to punish the company for last week’s disappointing fourth-quarter forecast. Amazon said revenue during the holiday quarter would grow 2% to 8% over the year-ago period, far below analysts’ estimates. The cloud division, Amazon Web Services, also reported weaker-than-expected sales.

It’s the first time Amazon’s market cap has been below $1 trillion since April 2020. The stock has plunged 42% in 2022 and is on pace for its worst year since 2008, when it dropped 45%. The only other year that was worse was during the dot-com crash of 2000, when the company lost 80% of its value.

Like the rest of Big Tech, Amazon has struggled this year due to a slumping economy, soaring inflation and rising interest rates. On top of that, Amazon has been forced to scale back after expanding dramatically during the pandemic, now that consumers have returned to stores.

Amazon has been the second-worst performer in the Big Tech group this year, behind Facebook parent Meta, which has plummeted 72%. Meta told investors last week that revenue in the fourth quarter would likely decline for a third straight period.

Captivating **TL;DR** today - **number go up.** Purchases are u**p 345% ($4.9M to $22M)** from the prior week along with sales, which increased +290% ($263M to $1B). The bulk of purchases stems from insiders at Mobileye Global Inc within the IT sector / Electronic Equipment industry. Active insiders and companies are up 18% and 25% respectively from the prior week.

# High-Level Stats:

* Purchases increased from $4.9M to $22M (+345%)
* Sales increased from $263.5M to $1.02B (+290%)
* Transactions increased from 267 to 316 (+18%)
* Companies represented in Form 4s increased from 170 to 200 (+18%)
   * Net buyers increased from 14 to 23 (+64%)
   * Net sellers increased from 156 to 177 (+13%)
* Insiders filing Form 4s increased from 234 to 292 (+25%)
   * Net buyers increased from 25 to 38 (52%)
   * Net sellers increased from 209 to 254 (+22%)

# Transaction Selection

1. **All** **Direct Open Market Transactions** from **October 24th - October 28th.** These are Form 4 filings with a Transaction Code of “P” or “S”. This narrows the scope to trades where insiders are putting their money on the line.
2. Weekly comparisons are to transactions from **October 17th - October 21st.**
3. **No companies without a ticker** (e.g. opportunity/income/mutual funds).

# Further Context

1. Form 4 data is impacted by a concept known as **backfill** which is par for the course with transactional data. The delay between the Filing Date and the Transaction Date is **\*roughly\*** 2 days and your mileage will vary. This means that **more transactions for past dates can arrive in future filings.** That is why looking at larger trends is key.
2. To combat backfill, filings through this Tuesday are included **\*if\*** the transaction date is from the prior week. Otherwise, transactions from this week are excluded.
3. Data is sourced by the algorithms behind [Form Fore](http://formfore.io/)

# Feedback/Updates

* All feedback, **good bad, and ugly** are welcome - aiming to make these as helpful as possible.
* The **public workbook** should be ready for initial release **sometime next week**. Will also share on Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/FormFore) if that is your preferred hub.
* The newsletter is likely a few weeks out and on my radar. I appreciate your patience!

(TRULIEVE, VERANO, GREENTHUMB, CRESCO, CURALEAF) 

Ontario, Canada-based licensed cannabis producer Canopy Growth’s plans to launch Canopy USA to accelerate its acquisitions of three American marijuana companies and remain listed on a major stock exchange might have provided a blueprint for U.S. companies.

American cannabis operators who touch the plant could follow the Canopy road map to uplist from the Canadian Securities Exchange to the Toronto Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq – provided they’re willing to do a major restructuring, experts told MJBizDaily.

The upside to listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), North America’s third-largest exchange, is that it could help cannabis companies attract more institutional investment.

So far, American plant-touching cannabis companies – such as multistate operators – haven’t been able to raise capital on major exchanges because of the federal illegality of cannabis in the U.S., opting instead to list on the Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE) and over-the-counter markets.

And that might still be a problem, at least for the Nasdaq, which expressed objections to Canopy’s plans and could delist the Smiths Falls-based company.

But the TSX has been more receptive, which could provide U.S. plant-touching operators an avenue for uplisting without waiting for the federal government to legalize marijuana or implement other major cannabis reforms.

In an email to MJBizDaily, Catherine Kee, spokesperson at TSX parent TMX Group, confirmed that Canopy worked directly with the exchange and shared its plans in advance of the announcement.

Kee declined to comment on whether U.S. companies could follow.

“We are aware that legislation applicable to the marijuana sector is evolving,” Kee said. “TMX continues to monitor the developments with interest and we remain committed to supporting the enduring success of the cannabis industry.”

In a note, equity analyst Owen Bennett of New York-based investment bank Jefferies Group wrote that the Toronto Stock Exchange’s approval of a Canopy listing could have major implications for U.S. operators through more M&amp;A by Canadian acquirers and/or enabling “U.S. (operators) to adopt the same structure and uplist to the TSX.”

Restructuring ‘gymnastics’
Kelly Fair – a partner with the international law firm Dentons and external counsel to Canopy’s new holding company Canopy USA – told MJBizDaily she’s proud of the creative approach she and the Canopy team have taken to accelerate U.S. market exposure.

Canopy USA will have a ring-fenced structure in which Canopy Growth would hold nonvoting, exchangeable shares in the holding company, segregating those U.S. assets from the rest of the company.


“To the extent that the substructure is embraced by at least the TSX, then that would provide the opportunity to the U.S. (multistate operators to uplist) potentially sooner than a full legalization event – if they wanted to go through the gymnastics to do structuring like this,” Fair said.

Any MSO looking to uplist would have to create a ring-fenced structure between the listed company and the company that’s actually touching the plant or holding the plant-touching entities, she said.

The pros and cons

Matt Karnes, founder of Greenwave Advisors, told MJBizDaily via email that the TSX is more expensive to list on than the CSE, but that it has more liquidity and more stringent listing requirements – which are both more appealing to institutional investors.

He also said Canopy could try to use TSX approval to pressure the Nasdaq to allow U.S. plant-touching businesses to list.

Another hitch, however, is whether Canopy’s auditors will sign off on consolidated financials that include plant-touching operations in the U.S.

“The Big 4 (accounting firms) have not engaged in U.S. cannabis thus far and this could signal a willingness to accept U.S. cannabis clients – a positive for U.S. cannabis as it gives added assurance to institutional investors as to the industry’s legitimacy,” he said.

Whatever happens, Karnes  believes U.S. multistate operators will follow Canopy’s lead, particularly if they don’t want to wait for legislation such as the Safe and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act that could pass during this lame-duck session of Congress.

“I think whatever path Canopy Growth USA takes, the MSOs will follow, and they don’t necessarily have to wait to see what happens with SAFE.”

50,wallstreetbets,Suspicious-Word-9514,self.wallstreetbets,19,"Macroscope | The Fed meeting preview: 4th 75bps rate-hike is on the way, is pivot coming next?","The Fed's two-day November meeting will end on Wednesday, and the market has well expected its fourth consecutive aggressive 75 basis point rate hike, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. The probability of a 75 basis point rate hike has reached as high as 85.5%, which would raise the federal funds rate to a range of 3.75%-4%, the highest level since 2008.

However, given the recent signals released by the Fed to slow down interest rate hikes, the market is likely to be more concerned about further signals from the Fed after the rate meeting on plans for a December rate hike and the direction of monetary policy next year. The Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has been vocal about the need to slow the pace of interest rate hikes at some point since July, and analysts believe he may also reiterate that point at this meeting. Additionally, a report by the ""New Fed Wire"" last week about the possibility of a slowdown in the Fed's aggressive policy in December continued to gather steam, with medium and long-term US bond yields topping out after hitting yearly highs.

Bloomberg economists said what is less certain is how Powell will communicate a potential future downshift in the rate-hike pace -- the degree of conviction, the risks around hike sizing, and implications for the terminal rate. Economists expect Powell to use 50 basis points present a 50-basis-point move as the base case and clarify that a downshift in the pace of rate hikes does not necessarily mean a lower terminal rate.

It is worth noting that the Fed’s November meeting is also just less than a week before the US mid-term elections. Undoubtedly, how to deal with the Republicans on the high-rise inflation and the risk of recession will become a major problem for Biden. And just last week, two Democratic senators urged Powell not to cause unnecessary pain by over-raising interest rates.

It has been said that there are now major divergences within the Fed on monetary policy. For example, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daley thinks the Fed should start discussions on slowing down rate hikes to avoid sending the economy into an ""unforced slump"". But Kansas Fed President Esther George believes that monetary policy needs to move into a restrictive range, and the strength remains to be watched. Given the recent volatility in the financial markets and the time it takes for interest rate hikes to affect the economy, the Fed cannot act too hastily.

There are also a few views that do not favour a pivot. Fed governor Michelle Bowman hopes to look for signs of falling inflation before slowing down the rate hike. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said he hopes to raise the policy rate to a level that would put meaningful downward pressure on inflation.

Therefore, for this meeting, FOMC members are expected to engage in a heated debate on how to steer interest rates to avoid a troubled economy.

“They may want to go slower just in the interest of financial stability,” said Julia Coronado, the founder of MacroPolicy Perspectives LLC. “It’s a challenge for messaging because they don’t want to ease financial conditions significantly. They need tight financial conditions to keep cooling the economy off. So he (Powell) doesn’t want to sound dovish, but he may want to go slower.”

Some institutions took a relatively cautious view. Nomura believes that the FOMC does not yet seem to have a consensus on the preferred size of a December rate hike, which will limit Powell's ability to provide guidance. The Fed chairman will reiterate that future policy will depend on economic data, including the two non-farm payrolls reports and, most importantly, the latest inflation data. Barclays also released a report saying that the Fed may leave its December policy options open, pending more information on inflation and tightening risks.

The [J.P. Morgan](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NYSE-JPM/) team, on the other hand, made relatively “accurate “predictions on the outcome of this meeting. Analysts believe the most likely scenario going to happen is a 75 basis point rate hike and a hawkish press release, which could allow Powell to retain selectivity for December and next year meetings, while highlighting the current risks of higher inflation. In this scenario, S&amp;P 500 may float between down 1% to up 0.5%. And if the Fed provides clear guidance for the December meeting, this is likely to be seen as dovish and S&amp;P 500 could rise by 2.5%-3%.

In addition, former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers also tweeted recently, saying that the “growing chorus” for the Fed to pause interest rate hikes very soon is “badly misguided.” In his view, the Fed should stick to its current course and not pause too soon, especially given that it has a history of “past errors”.

Aside from rate hikes, let's not forget the glooming recession hanging over the US. Concerns were fuelled last week by the inversion in the 3-month/10-year US bond yields. Prior to this, the 2/10-year US bond inversion had been going on for almost five months. Given the historically extremely high success rate of both yield curves in predicting crisis, there is growing concern about how the Federal Reserve will respond to outside concerns about the economy.

Notably, Jerome Powell had said in the press conference after the September meeting that the goal of fighting inflation had not changed and would be maintained until the task completed, and the federal funds rate would need to be kept at a restrictive level for a certain time. But the FOMC had already revised down the US economic growth rate to 0.2% this year.

It is worth noting that while consumers, the engine of the US economy, are still maintaining spending in the face of inflationary pressures, danger signals are beginning to reveal. The US Department of Commerce said last week that consumer spending growth slowed to a near two-year low of 1.4% from 2.0% in the previous quarter, and consumer purchasing power continues to retreat at a 3% rate and US families are gradually running out of federal financial subsidies in the COVID pandemic.",0.76,11,0,11,question,2022-11-02T14:27:47Z,yk3wmu,t3

65,wallstreetbets,asmit10,self.wallstreetbets,4,$CCJ - Uranium Miner trying to break out of a 8 year downtrend,"$CCJ

Camerco claims:

Uranium inventories are low

Secondary supply is low

Nobody has been investing in supply

‘never started a cycle with this high of a uranium price’

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Camerco appears to be a good steward of capital and understands the market dynamics involved with being a supplier of a not-so-rare mineral

Camerco had \~10% of world uranium production in 2021

China adding \~150 nuclear power plants by 2035

China’s nuclear power generation in the past 10 years has been so great - that it has made up for Europe’s staunch stance on decommissioning - leading to the largest nuclear power plant power generation of all time in 2021. It is conceivable that the west is beginning to realize their mistake and are beginning the process of fixing it, out of necessity from Russia’s and Saudi Arabia’s oil cartel.

Yes, oil manufacturing is going to spike. Oil supply will eventually outpace demand, the Russian war will end, and energy prices will stabilize…but with China investing so much into low-cost energy, will the west want to remain dependent on Russia for economic stability?

Even the most anti-nuclear governments are temporarily halting their decision to decommission 30 year old plants

200 - 400 nuclear power plants to be decommissioned by 2040

Camerco recently announced a deal to buy Westinghouse..

…and Poland just announced they’re building their first nuclear power plant and chose the U.S. and Westinghouse to build their first Nuclear Power Plant.

According to [World-nuclear.org](https://World-nuclear.org): 

About 90 power reactors with a total gross capacity of about 90,000 MWe are on order or planned, and over 300 more are proposed. Most reactors currently planned are in Asia, with fast-growing economies and rapidly-rising electricity demand.

&amp;#x200B;

Major uranium miners are seeing a demand increase in Uranium out to 2024 - and are subsequently significantly increasing production, including Camerco

Many western governments have started initiatives to support nuclear initiatives

Last quarter financial results showed negative earnings because they wrote off the expanse of restarting a mine. They previously shut the mine off due to poor uranium market performance.

Their main competitor is also increasing uranium production. They are both doing so based on contracts they’ve obtained and plan to obtain - neither seem to participate in the spot market in a material way.

&amp;#x200B;

Technically speaking, $CCJ has begun trying to break out of a major downtrend going back to 2014.

$CCJ Reiterated multiple times that they see strong profit going forward, and see production along with spot rates increasing. Given this, the Russian - Saudi oil regime, China's emergence as the nuclear energy super power, a massive reversal in short-term power plant decomissioning, the global incentive to go nuclear (Low long term cost, removal of complete reliance on oil, 'going green'), and  the material fact that Western governments have begun to spend money supporting this thesis...

&amp;#x200B;

Do you guys have any thoughts?

&amp;#x200B;

I'll leave with a headline I found:

Article dated: 6 Oct 2022

# No nuclear power ‘renaissance’ as Europe wrestles energy crisis

""...But after eight months of fighting in Ukraine, and an energy crisis compounded most recently by the alleged sabotage of the arterial Nord Stream 1 and 2 Russia-to-Europe pipelines in the Baltic Sea, European governments long opposed to nuclear power have shown only incremental shifts in their attitudes, which have been informed by years of concerns about nuclear waste and safety.

&amp;#x200B;

A wider pivot has remained absent.

&amp;#x200B;

“We’re not talking about a nuclear renaissance, as such,” Nicolas Berghmans, an energy and climate expert at the France-based Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations (IDDRI), told Al Jazeera, “but maybe more of a change of tide.”

&amp;#x200B;

“A real nuclear renaissance would be if Europe decides to invest in more nuclear power plants.”""",0.83,8,0,8,dd,2022-11-02T10:50:05Z,yjzuta,t3

Just a quick edit: [M2 Money Stock over the last 60 years](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL)

u/Infamous_Sympathy_91 's [post on credit card debt and personal savings from earlier today](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yjowp1/us_personal_savings_near_historic_lows/)


In 2020 money stopped moving. I wrote this in some of my previous posts and comments. In order to prop up economic activity, central banks increased money supply with almost 0 interest a.k.a Brrrrrr.

So ideally fresh minted money is distributed in the real economy and moves up and trickles down and so forth. As you can see in the chart above, money hasn't been moving as much in the economy since the peak in 2000; It's in constant decline with a hard fall in 2020.

Today central banks are trying to battle inflation. As you can see in the chart above, money isn't moving as much, so it's not that there is too much money in the real economy. Whatever they printed in the last 2 years went up to the big black void of finance. All the derivatives market, swaps, trenches and all sorts of made up bullshit has sucked up money faster than your wife sucking her boyfriend's cock.

Inflation is a product of price gauging and artificial crises, such as cutting down oil production, slowing down logistics around the globe, lagging or harsh response to the pandemic by governments etc.

What you're seeing with the interest rate increases will only hit small businesses and working people. Casino always wins. Banks will own everything. You will own nothing at the end of this.

In the next two years, you will lose your jobs, you will lose your homes if you have debt. You will start selling your assets until capitalism owns your ass. We had reached a point of multi-generational wealth with too many high net worth individuals. Those who are pulling the strings are actively sabotaging the economy and are robbing you.

The interest rates will once again go down, when most people lose everything and you can't borrow anymore. This isn't about bringing the inflation down by decreasing money spent in real economy. The chart in the link clearly shows you that there is no increased activity which would increase velocity of money.

So tomorrow or in the next year don't get your hopes up too much. Your average working class ape is in more debt than before and savings are at an all time low. The latest surge in house prices also guaranteed that banks and through them the central banks owns you.

This is the final stage of capitalism. Good luck to you all.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%. (Stats as of 2022-10-28)",0.81,13,0,13,dd,2022-11-02T03:10:54Z,yjr9oh,t3

So you like to make money fast? Is your motto Lambo or food stamps? This it’s for you. At 2 PM ET FOMC announcement made. A large price movement occurs at this time , this movement creates a fair gap value , as Powell starts to speak at 2:30 ET a counter move starts to test price movement created at release of hike announcement occurs. This can easily 2x-4x your 0 dte SPY option if it goes well if it doesn’t you lose 100% of your initial gamble I mean investment. This same pattern has occurred for the last two years . It doesn’t guarantee that it will happen again. Risky scalp with large potential for profit/losses. Just to reiterate if price has a large move up at 2 pm ET than just before 2:30 ET buy puts, if price has a large move down at 2 pm ET than just before 2:30 ET buy calls . This strategy has become rather popular in discord channels/twitter. No positions at the moment as strategy needs to be executed at FOMC.",0.5,0,0,0,dd,2022-11-02T01:46:07Z,yjpc8o,t3

24,wallstreetbets,DaddyDersch,self.wallstreetbets,48,"11-1-22 SPY/ ES Futures, Apple and Tesla Daily TA","It was the night before FOMC and all through the markets there was oddities… I had mentioned last night actually in my TA that I expect at some point markets were going to get shocked by a big drop intraday instead of this recovery rip… that day was today. 

The interesting thing about today is that VOLD (volume) actually came in bullish at open and through the whole day pretty much until right before power hour VOLD was actually in extreme bull momentum. Now SPY could not break out and break away from 385 level. The thoughts are we either watched markets be held up by volume or there was just some weird stuff going on today. There was some dark pool prints hitting the tapes again today. 

The other interesting thing that I noted today is that this is the first time that the day before FOMC the VIX has been red (and especially didn’t spike) since the June FOMCs. The last two FOMCs were the first with a spike of the VIX the day before. 

What does that mean ? well im not quite sure but those months of FOMC were more bullish. 

&amp;#x200B;

We also have quite a few articles released today saying that Biden supports a pivot of the fed (this was later slightly walked back though). 

My initial thoughts on what to expect tomorrow is that JPOW drops a 75bps (I would be SHOCKED to see a 50bps) but then he should hint at a “we will remain data dependent but there is a case to slow hikes if we continue to see optimism and to fully evaluate the effects of rate hikes.” 

But tomorrow will be interesting to say the least!

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ig9cg0t6hex91.png?width=773&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=358cc3b9af8b4e8c28541c1fa6b63f0f176b3cad

This TA is going to be pretty brief as markets gonna move however the algos want it to with FOMC. 

But overall we did attempt to breakout over 390.1 resistance of the green channel. With that pretty stout rejection we are not finding support which we did find almost all day at 385. This could if we get a green day tomorrow also be seen as a nice daily 8ema/ 50ema support test. In addition I am seeing that the 8ema is crossing back over the 50ema (bullishly) for the first time in two months. 

The rejection at 390.1 also was a rejection of the daily 100ema which im not super surprised by as this level is usually a bigger fight. Markets will need the push from good FOMC news tomorrow to break through these key levels and breakout until CPI. 

Key support- 380.1 -&gt; 377.8 -&gt; 374.1

Key resistance- 388.6 -&gt; 390.1 -&gt; 393 -&gt; 397.8 (my potential target for a bullish FOMC)

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9bgssm97hex91.png?width=805&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9783ca967b5792443220149d07832cbaa52a8ad0

Looking at futures we have actually had this pattern play out just last week where we found support and managed to push up for an extreme green day. 

With a rejection of that 200ema today and that 3925 level that will remain key resistance and we will look for that level to be closed over tomorrow to continue to be bullish. 

Key support- 3845 -&gt; 3800

Key resistance- 3885 -&gt; 3925 -&gt; 3975

&amp;#x200B;

Apple has nearly retraced all the way back to where it was Friday before that massive rip on earnings. I wish I woulda been smart enough to short it Friday at market close. Apple was able to back test and hold the daily 8/50ema support lines today, however fell and closed under the 100/200ema. 

Key support- 148 -&gt; 146

Key resistance- 153.4 -&gt; 155.7 -&gt; 157.4

&amp;#x200B;

Tesla actually had a pretty nice pop today and broke through (but failed to close over) a key level. I was mentioning as you can see that 205 to 230 red channel on tesla. With this break through I am actually looking at an upside move on tesla (despite FOMC). 

This is its first time its broken through key 230 resistance since October 7th. We still have not closed over 230 though but as long as tesla holds over its daily 8ema and continues to hold this red bull channel I will remain bullish on it. 

Key support- 230 -&gt; 224.8 -&gt; 219.2

Key resistance- 234.2 -&gt; 239.6

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mmpr6qc9hex91.png?width=503&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58c636921894dc187d9689ff9e4c84edfd019809

As I had mentioned this is the first FOMC since June that the VIX has not popped significantly the day before. To me this means markets are bullish. I think that anything super hawkish for the FOMC tomorrow especially if he says 75bps in December the VIX is going to spike like no other and we could very well end up with a huge red day. However, I remain bullish and I think JPOW wont say anything to tip the markets down tomorrow. 

10% challenge-

Overall today was yet again another untradeable day after the first big move. Was able to get some nice scalps in today. And with an average down on my SPY and Tesla puts this morning at open I was able to close the SPY level to level puts for green and close the Tesla level to level puts for a smaller loss (they were very red at open). I don’t like DCAing to win a play like that but I didn’t expect that massive pre-market and with SPY holding under and beginning to dump off the key 390.1 resistance at open I felt confident in the DCA.

TLDR for my fellow apes:

\- A scientist started mapping multiple countries' claimed economic growth numbers to the increase in city lights seen from satellites

\- He found a high correlation between the two in democratic countries that had a free press and independent parties measuring the numbers

\- He found a large discrepancy between the two in autocratic regimes that controlled the reporting agencies and the press (shocker!)

\- Tested his theory against reasons why totalitarian countries might have fewer lights when experiencing massive economic growth (hey! they like working and living in the dark! They're allergic to electricity! They care more about the environment!). Nothing seemed to stand up to scrutiny.

\- Based on the growth in lights, he estimates that China's growth was less than half what they claimed. This means that China's GDP is likely less than half of the US rather than nearly equal

\- The other side of the coin is that their total debt levels might be between 600-700% of GDP rather than 300%

\- Paper has been peer-reviewed and presented at multiple economic conferences

I know it's pretty mind-blowing to think China might actually lie about something like this given their honest and transparent dealings to date but you have to admit the science is pretty spiffy.",0.87,391,0,391,news,2022-11-01T22:09:25Z,yjjsm5,t3

TLDR- we could go higher but we have more uncertainty in the near future as opposed to the last 2 weeks.

Some important dates to keep in mind:

Nov. 2nd- FOMC day

Nov. 10th- Oct. CPI data

Cant post the chart cus VisualMod keeps on taking it down.

Simple as seeing the last bear market rally and then applying it to now. We saw a rising wedge form on the monthly chart which is happening now. If the fed says it will indeed be ""kinder and gentler"" in any way shape or form you better bet your bottom dollar we will go to 408. However, on the off chance, the Fed says it will continue to bring more pain all your calls will be worthless in a few days. Now keep in mind that Oct. CPI will also determine if we continue to keep going higher even after a Fed ""pivot"". If CPI comes in hot we could see a similar drop back down to 350.

My plan- Wait till FOMC to see if the fed is indeed going to be kinder and gentler. If so buy $400 calls then take out my initial before CPI and if CPI is hot buy $360 puts.",0.59,5,0,5,dd,2022-11-01T21:44:03Z,yjj173,t3

**price\_efficiency:** how much are you losing to the bid/ask spread? Higher number the better. 

**expected\_move:** this is a percentage of the expected move, as priced by the ATM calls and puts, for this stock by expiration date (this Friday)

How to use this in your trading? 

Do you think **DASH** will move more than 14% by Friday? If not, sell options. If you think it will move for than that, I guess you might want to go long (debit) an option (not recommended). 

Do you want to trade **INTC**? Notice how the put\_IV is double that of calls. That means traders are bidding up the puts, and bidding down the calls relative to each other. If you think its going up, sell those puts and buy the calls. 

Want to trade **SBUX**? Realize that you will lose roughly 2% immediately when filling your trade and another 2% immediately when you exit. This is how the bid/ask spread works.

* The comments do not necessarily signal any pending actions against TikTok.
* The Treasury and Justice Departments are the ones leading a review and negotiations with the company.

Shares of U.S. social media companies Snap and Meta spiked on the news that a Federal Communications Commissioner said the U.S. government should ban TikTok.

“I don’t believe there is a path forward for anything other than a ban,” Republican Commissioner Brendan Carr told Axios in an interview.

Snap shares were up 6% and Meta shares were up 4% Tuesday afternoon.

The comments from Carr, one of four current commissioners at the Democrat-led agency, do not necessarily signal any pending actions against TikTok.

The Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS) in the Treasury Department is reviewing the company’s potential national security implications, given its ownership by a Chinese company, ByteDance. And the Department of Justice is the one leading negotiations over a security deal, The New York Times reported in September.

Concerns over TikTok’s potential security risks are generally bipartisan. Both the Trump and Biden administrations have expressed concerns and reviewed the company’s relationship with its Chinese owner. TikTok has maintained that it stores U.S. user data outside of China so that it would not have to turn over that information to the government, but U.S. officials have maintained their skepticism.

“Commissioner Carr has no role in the confidential discussions with the U.S. government related to TikTok and appears to be expressing views independent of his role as an FCC commissioner,” a TikTok spokesperson said a statement.

For those non-gamers out there Turtle Beach is like the HTC smart phone of the gaming headset/accessory market. It is essentially universally hated. Let's remember consumer spending is down, much larger and more diverse competitors in this space are down, tech companies in general down.

**If LOGITECH is hurting TURTLE BEACH is near fatal condition**

This was Logitechs last quarterly report...

Net Income: **-41.13%**

Net Profit Margin: **-33.15%**

Top line revenue: **-12.04%**

This was Turtle Beach ($HEAR) last quarterly report...

Net Income: **-1,135.79%**

Net Profit Margin: **-2,070.78%**

Top line revenue: **-47.43%**

All this being said you must remember Logitech is a much larger company approx. 80 times the size of Turtle Beach. with a **much greater range of products.**

Sounds like Turtle Beach needs to create a much diverse range of products to compete... Well that's exactly what they have been doing although they didn't realize the recession was just around the corner. They have expanded their product line into smartphone gaming controllers, XLR microphones, and flight simulator controllers. I believe/hope that their upcoming quarterly report on 11/3 after market is abysmal. **Just check out the open interest on $7 11/18 PUTS.**

**TL;DR, $Hear is going to be buried in the sand over an increasingly difficult market to compete in while burning cash desperately trying to stay afloat.**

This is the worst. Why bother putting in the effort if no one is going to see it?

Our data shows that post and comment removals for new users are a huge deterrent and the reason why many people stop contributing. 

Over the years we've really tried to make it easier to post (some might say it's too easy...) but when things do get caught, the options are few and terrible. 

You can:

1. Complain about mods, say fuck Reddit, and never come back

2. Send a modmail in and at best get a reply 30 minutes later (by which time your submission is dead)

...and that's it.

#Introducing a third option:

3. Hop into a voice channel and immediately speak with a moderator who can reinstate your post

This is one of many new moderation features we're excited to ship that will make submitting posts easier than ever. 

This is just one step towards encouraging more high quality, high effort, posts back into the sub.

I’m only a year old member of the page, but thought i’d share my thoughts because while this page is fun, it can also be toxic at times and not overly helpful or insightful. That being said, there are plenty of times I have seen positivity and  insight. I’m not a professional at this at all, but thought i’d share my thoughts after my first year of trading options…. But first here was my trade today:

I took a short position (bought puts) on TSLA towards the top of its 207-226 channel this morning. Took 2 contacts at 220ish. 1 additional contract at 223ish. I had my stop loss set, and then went to my actual job. The thesis was that it would get back to 207 support in short to mid term.


 I obviously got very lucky that TSLA severely underperformed today and happened to hit my target. I’ve always hung on to losers too long and winners too short, so i was sure to move my stop to break even when it moved my way, and then continually moved my stop up as the trade worked in my favor. Eventually got stopped out around 206 for $1,710. Felt nice because the risk reward was there, and everything made sense, obviously lucky that TSLA was weak with twitter debacle, but nice to have one go my way.


I’m now long two contracts as you can see above. Thesis is TSLA will return to 220s and stay within this channel in short to mid term. If i get stopped out monday, so be it, but the risk reward for me makes sense.


Things i’ve learned the last year: 


1. I can’t trade 0dte contracts. It’s straight gambling for me and i suck at that. I’m also too busy with my actual job to monitor trades like these which i assume require a high level of attention to detail. 3-4 Weeks minimum preferred for me.


2. The trade has to have a clear out front thesis that doesn’t evolve to fit your bias as the trade plays out.

3. Position sizing is so important for my financial and mental well being. I have to be sure to never risk more than a certain percentage of my portfolio. “Preserve precious capital” as a famous trader says makes sense to me


4. The better my mental and physical health the clearer my mind is with trading.


5. Mistakes happen. Basically blew up my account last fall when beginning options and while i hated myself, it taught me a lot about myself, and my tendencies.

6. I prefer to stick with one stock and listen to a few youtubers i like that analyze it. Simple things like supply and demand level, rsi and macd, and paying attention to fed news and the indices.

I’m not an OG here, but thought i’d share my thoughts and a positive trade i made as i continue to grow and improve. Maybe the mods will remove, idk. TGIF


TLDR: i have learned the hard way about risk management, having a real thesis before trades, and avoiding theta decay/ giving myself time on trades by picking better (in my opinion) expiration dates. Also, if i can’t sleep or feel anxious after the closing bell, i know i am not sizing properly and over risking …

# Risk Analysis - Statistical Analysis

Taking in count the stock's price movement from 2002 to 2022, we have the following data:

|Expected Minimum Return|0.16%|
|:-|:-|
|Variance|0.26%|
|Standard Deviation|5.07%|

Taking in count the stock's price movement from 1st December 2021 to Today, 5th November 2022, we have the following data: 4739

Statistically Speaking, investing in GME has a high probability to give you a return around -5 and 5%, with 43.46% of the data population between -5% and 0 and 45.94% between 0 and 5%.

This gives us a 10.60% chance to get an outlier return from the historical data.

Standard Deviation suggests a 13.11% to ride on a price movement higher than 5% or lower than -5%. In the long run the chance of getting outlier is reduced to 5%.

The FED has raised rates to 4%, we will factor in a 4.50% rate instead.

Risk Free Rate is 4.15%

# Final Comment

With its current amount of Cash &amp; Cash Equivalents and without any drastic changes in the company structure and business model, GME is expected to burn is cash within 35 Months. Taking in mind receivables and other liquidity, it still have 39 months remaining in operation.

The company can avoid this by taking more loans or selling parts of the company and other assets.

Company doesn't pass Acid Test, and it is in a dire financial struggle to survive.

Still expecting negative income and cash flow from operations for 2023.

Debt is not critical, this shall allows some room for a possible long term loan.

Current Cash can cover only 94% of current liabilities. The company should be able to cover it with receivables.

ROE, ROA, ROIC and ROC terrible.

ROE is in recover, so GG

ROIC worsen and ROA is stable

This suggest that, yes the management is trying to fix the company, with some positive outcome, but they are struggling a lot right now.

Income quality getting away from danger zone, but still in bad situations.

Gross profit margin worsened. Company cannot manage well costs, this is probably due to inflation and macro.

There are ""***Strategic and Operational Risks Related to Digital Asset Initiatives""*** *that can have huge positive impact as well as dire outcome if it fails. This is a huge risk factor.*

In the mid term, 1-2 years, the company shall gradually trade down from current price to $15 with possible spikes due to external factors. Expect (90% chance) movements between -5% and 5% cause historical price action with a 10% chance to cash in or go tits up.

Fundamentals point toward bankruptcy, but as for now, if the management play their card well there is a possibility to recover.

With current balance sheet, market  health and macro, the company is fucked up.

consider a stock that has experienced several highs and lows over the last year through both bullish and bearish trending patterns. A technical analyst using a Bollinger  channel may see that the price is approaching its support trendline. If the stock has a positive weighted alpha it can be an affirmation that the stock’s price has largely been gaining over the last year, **supporting another bulish push higher.**


**why is a European Germany company rising its revenue guidance when apparently Europe is gone to sh**t ? You will find out why it is my honest opinion that Warren buffets reasoning to buy when everyone fears is can be applied for Bayer**

The 2022, full year growth outlook raise  is significant, particularly in its crop science division;:

1. Now expecting a 10% previously 5% in the seed and crop protection market for 2022, driven high quality prices for seeds and crop commodities and inflation.

2. Pharmaceutical division to expand by 6% previously 5%

3.conhmsr health 5% from 4% 

**remember this is just by the end of 2022, if the conditions persist the growth outlook widens, it seems like  the basic needs or medication and crops are recession proof when picking the correct company**

**The top 2 challenges  and why they are going in favour of Bayer** 

**1) litgations 2) europe economy**

**European economy and the rise of the germans** 

**The dark winter**
- we all know European is heading into a difficult winter, although energy prices have gone down since i write this, it is no guarantee they will remain so. However, the germans are going to spend there way out of this winter and are poised to avoid a recession in 2023.

*it has already begun*

Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase. 



1) winter recession avoided 

https://m.ca.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/germany-dodges-recession-but-inflation-climbs-to-116-2811016

Why will it benefit the underlying stock? 

Spending - stocks go up in spending times bud. 

2) surprising growth,  will it be enough to outpace inflation ?  For 2023  Germany is likely to be okay, and Bayers product are essentials, during hard times Bayer makes money as well.

https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/short_news/germany-under-fire-for-canibalistic-e200-billion-investment/

3) relief plan makes  the EU  worried, if Germany avoid recession by spending, other European nations will want to follow the idea,  inflation cannot be controlled like this. EU therefore sounds the alarm and potential consequences, it is likely that not too many nations will follow suit in my opinion , Germany can afford to be spending, not many  European nations can, making Germany the exception, in fact if Germany being the biggest economy in Europe  makes it through, much of Europe will also make I through. 

The worried citi suggest the following 

*The proposals could cut 2 percentage points off inflation in the next year, according to Citi, but they are unlikely to prevent an economic contraction. The package “may soften the coming recession but also poses risks, in our view,” Citi analysts said in a note released last Friday.*

Why are we using words like economic contraction  all of a sudden instead of recession?

- **The litigations over roundup** and *glysophate*


 Bayer is still facing litigations due to the acquisition of Monsanto and RoundUp and during the last earnings call, Werner Baumann gave updated numbers. There are about 141,000 claims in total and about 108,000 have been settled.

Remember they have already set the cash aside, have won or litigated the majority of all cases. The rest are likely to head the same path.

Here is glysophate  surging 300% in 2021 https://www.agweb.com/news/crops/crop-production/glyphosate-prices-soar-much-300-and-thats-if-you-can-even-get-it

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king: 

Take a look at some of these charts in the past 59 years  have crop production globally  ever decreased over time ? Never, ever.

Counter point and what investors should know :


For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic. This includes recent conclusions by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the EU’s Assessment Group on Glyphosate (AGG), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), and the leading health authorities in Germany, Australia, Korea, Canada, New Zealand, and Japan.

I read online that a Form 25 has to be filed with US securities regulator SEC within 60 days of the first issue of proxy soliciting materials for voting on matters related to the buyout. This form certifies that the stock will be delisted by the exchange upon completion of the merger.

On September 02, Zendesk published the first round of proxy soliciting materials. The deal was then approved by Zendesk shareholders during a meeting on September 19. The Form 25 was now most likely has already been filed around November 02.

The Form 25 won't be made available to the public or be ""considered valid"" unless Zendesk issues a press release indicating completion of the deal, and that the exchange has received evidence of a certificate of merger from Zendesk. Upon all conditions being satisfied, the exchange removes the listing 10 days after the Form 25 becomes public. In 90 days, the SEC nullifies the registration of the securities. If Zendesk were to go public in the future, it would be assigned a new CUSP ID.

When a stock gets delisted as a result of a company going private, options are cash settled for the difference between the buyout price and the strike price.

Given that deals tend to be completed within a week of the Form 25 being drafted and confidentially submitted to the SEC, are you guys willing to risk $5 to buy 77 dollar call options expiring 11/11/2022 in anticipation of the deal closing next week?

# TLDR

Zendesk is incorporated in Delaware according to SEC filings.

If the status changes to an L (consolidated), the transaction has went through.

[https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/Ecorp/EntitySearch/NameSearch.aspx](https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/Ecorp/EntitySearch/NameSearch.aspx)

Zendesk apparently has a charitable foundation, and  the status for their charitable organization will likely change from Exempt to M (Merged) one day early before Zendesk Inc changes their status from General to L (Consolidated) .

**FILE         NUMBER ENTITY NAME**

5606971  ZENDESK CHARITABLE FOUNDATION

4661237   ZENDESK, INC.

[https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/Ecorp/FieldDesc.aspx#ENTITY%20TYPE](https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/Ecorp/FieldDesc.aspx#ENTITY%20TYPE)

It apparently costs 20 dollars each time I want to refresh the status of the entity or to check their filing history :(

Changing the status of a company from General to Merged takes about 2-3 weeks apparently, or 24 hours if expedited services are requested.

After getting the certificate of merger between Zendesk Charitable and Zendesk Inc, the company needs to pursue a certificate of consolidation to create a new holding company. When all the documents are prepared, they are sent to the company through snail mail.

If you are checking the site for real time updates, clicking on the link of a consolidated company will likely cause you to be redirected to the original search page.

If you click on any one of the corporations and the unofficial certificate of good standing fails to load, the company's status has also been changed to consolidation. A potential merger arbitrage will be available since return mail does take at least 1 day.",0.78,5,0,5,question,2022-11-04T23:55:35Z,ymbn97,t3

One of the biggest intraday dumps and recoveries I have seen in a long time and also one of the first times ive seen it with the VIX at such a low level. 

Next week we have election midterms and we have CPI. I will this weekend or next week sometimes post my CPI trade plan to the server but for now here is my expectations for CPI next week after running the numbers. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/elizrxa930y91.png?width=484&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=523d615fe4c4afde022a1f70471e1cc3a5b4bae9

Lets take a little more of a zoomed out look on the daily this time. What do we see? We see that we are still well within that green bear channel of 2022 and are holding right around that red dotted 50% retracement line. We have also formed over the last 2 months now a very sizeable black rising wedge that support was actually reconfirmed on today. We also held the red channel support of 370.6 extremely well today and rejected the 378 channel resistance all in one single day (which is impressive). Effectively we are stuck in this train and rising wedge until otherwise proven. 

Bull case for next week- bulls want to see a midterm election week rally and see a rally into CPI. First step is taking out that 378 resistance and establishing that as support. From there its time to take the red resistance line out from FOMC and look to retest the daily 100ema resistance around 388-390. 

Bear case for next week- with a looming CPI ahead and the FOMC pivot on the pivot this week bears will look to continue to reject 378 channel resistance and eventually break through and close under the 370.5 support and break the support of the black rising wedge. Once that is broken bears have opened the downside to re-test the 350 to 360 support area. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2bfkkd5a30y91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e512c7c006be622548dd43c6fd3a4df6d5346c99

On the weekly timeframe you can see we actually did break the rising wedge that is present from last week. However, we did come down and retest the weekly 200ema and confirmed that as support this week. With this candle body closing inside of last weeks bears and bulls both have an opportunity to break out next week and this could be the start of a bull flag if the bulls can defend 375.9 next week. 

Key support- 375.9 -&gt; 363.6 -&gt; 357

Key resistance- 390.2 -&gt; 408.6

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2jv8guqa30y91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b0221f5520ba291ee83d3caff612c9865da3810

Futures has a similar rising wedge formed with the downside resistance from FOMC. Overall a really nice double bottom and bullishly engulfing candle on futes daily that should provide some upside for Monday next week. Bulls need to retake that 3805 resistance next week early and bears will look to take out 3710 support early next week. Both of these remain key pivot points for futures. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/eufo1b8b30y91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5a7796d72bee08c5cf9213acc44204d9a54b92e

Futures (SPY too really) has a overall macro falling wedge with a blue bull channel that has a blue/ red rising wedge inside of it… yay TA! Overall this was a double top on the weekly at 3910, however, this could easily form into a 3775 double bottom come Sunday night at open and easily lead to an upside push next week. With the weekly 200ema being held once again we should look at upside not downside. 

Key support- 3775 -&gt; 3705 -&gt; 3590

Key resistance- 3910 -&gt; 4085

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gc2wolqb30y91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=60a77eadeef4c232598cc943d91664050aeb060d

Apple had one of the most interesting intradays I have seen on a non major catalysts day in a long time. Apple went all the day down to the October CPI LOD within one penny and someone still managed to rally back and close over 138.2. I actually REALLY would have liked to take apple calls with this closure back over key 138.2 support but it was EOD and too late plus I already had TESLA calls im swinging and SPY I opened instead. 

Apple will look to attempt to gap fill that 145 gap for the bulls and bears are going to attempt to close under 138.2 and put in a new 52 week low. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i9ifx6bc30y91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0cb54a497a1a26685abc6a65cae03b3bf8c0f2b6

The weekly show just how strong this 138.2 support is for Apple and why I was so ready to pull the trigger on calls but was too slow. You can also see that Apple did close back under its weekly 100ema and put In its biggest red week since March 2020 during the COVID crash. 

Key support – 138.2 -&gt; 133.3 -&gt; 129.1

Key resistance- 141.2 -&gt; 147.1 -&gt; 150.8

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5zuvm9uc30y91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b43a51e50533e8fc418a07d6c2c691cb3f289590

Tesla as I had mentioned continues to range in that 205.6 to 234 red channel. I had played some overnight calls on tesla for a huge 47.8% win at open on a 7dte and thankfully closed at open because wow did it get absolutely smacked down. Tesla put in a $20.72 drop from HOD to LOD which was 156% of its average 10day range. A pretty impressive range for Tesla that’s for sure. The biggest thing we have forming here on Tesla is that huge blue/ black diamond and we bounced hard one again off the 205.6 support range. I will be looking for an upside move next week on Tesla and remain bullish especially as long as we continue to hold 205.6 support. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/iztfevdd30y91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3775a029fe4ebe54c829bb59a9c5508c917f74b1

AS you can see on Tesla weekly chart we are still within that downward bear channel and did reject an attempt to breakout over the weekly 8ema. There is also a breakout triangle forming with key level of 224.2 and 207.8 for next week. 

Key supports- 204.4 -&gt; 192.1

Key resistance- 228.3 -&gt; 245

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/157xkwhe30y91.png?width=610&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad41f6767f0490a95c28e16704e60fc6bbd4cee0

We finally saw some volatility with the VIX today with a pretty large rebound spike when we had that huge 1115am dump. However, the vix remains in the downward channel and realistically until we see that resistance broken and see a major major bearish catalyst (cough CPI cough) I wouldn’t be shorting just yet. You COULD start adding slow longer DTE puts like 30-60 dte but I feel you are still early and are just wasting money. WE are also approaching that key 23.6 VIX support area and funny enough before the September CPI we actually were right at the 23.6 support area too. Perhaps we see a pretty bullish three days next week on the markets much like September leading into CPI and then CPI starts the next leg down headed into December. 

Overall I lean for a bullish Monday at least with a possible choppy Tuesday/ Wednesday as markets prepare for CPI but there is a very good chance we could see a pretty impressive green week next week and end up all the back up near 390 before CPI hits. The higher we are the bigger drop I believe CPI could potentially bring for us. 

Daily log- 

This was another amazing week for me. The week really did suck Monday and Tuesday and then after taking that bigger L on Wednesday I was able to recover today and end up finishing the week off going 11 for 11 today with 4 for 4 on scalps and 7 for 7 on level to level plays. Note- a lot of people are inquiring more about my level to level plays so this is something I will once again try to cover and I will make a post this weekend about it I hope. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jshjt4ze30y91.png?width=888&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fccc1c3e198a4ab59265a8fb834330bfc48e8ecd

Interestingly enough… this is now the 2nd week in a row where my level to level plays have netted a greater profit then my actual scalps. This is something I will continue to monitor as time goes forward and I will continue to adjust as time goes on. This week was also extremely tough to scalp as Monday and Tuesday were very untradeable and then Wednesday with the IV spiking was tougher to trade too for big gains. However, with this being the 2nd week in a row with these results I will continue to monitor and see going forward if this trend holds. But for anyone following me who struggles to get in on the scalps while obviously the win rate is no perfect on the L2L plays and never will be with the built in price target stop loss and take profit target (tho I regrettably always take profits early) the profits should greatly outweigh the losses. Definitely something to keep in mind going forward for me. 

Youtube will be up later!  
 

Hope you guys had a great week. See you next week!",0.85,14,0,14,dd,2022-11-04T23:17:31Z,ymaqa7,t3

I’m new to wsb, I discussed my stocks more with friends but they all gave up on trading lol. I made big profits in the last years with Tesla and other tech stuff (about 500%). I was basically a buy and hold investor but started with options some months ago to leverage my portfolio. It did well but I’m less optimistic now. I think the next years will be though and shorting the Nasdaq 100 is still a good move now. But I’ll still hold Tesla and Apple. Maybe some other large caps too - It’s hard to let them go after all those years of profits.

The only thing I’m really optimistic right now is Porsche. It startet only about one month ago and the Porsche family is happily buying back as much stocks as possible. They set a very low price on the stock to buy it back very cheap. I think they secretly want to buy back everything to own it again like in the early 2000s. I’m not sure if they are genius or crazy… Anyway I also calculated a target price of 154€ per share in the short term and expect it much higher if they really want to buy it back. The fundamentals and future are amazing and I bought lots of lots of calls. Maybe some of you have also looked at P911 and wants to discuss it.

1,wallstreetbets,caprazzi,self.wallstreetbets,6,Paramount (PARA) - The Cheapest Stock in the Market,"Just coming on to share the mind-bogglingly low valuation of Paramount (PARA). Consider the following:

1.) Paramount possesses the fastest growing streaming offering in the market, Paramount+.

2.) Paramount owns CBS and has the rights to broadcast most NFL games as well as Premier League Soccer.

3.) Paramount Pictures has had a wildly successful year, including the release of Top Gun Maverick, the 5th highest grossing film of all time. 

Despite this, PARA shares are trading at an embarrassingly low valuation:

1.) Price/earnings multiple of less than 8.

2.) Approximately one third price/sales.

3.) Less than half of book value.

Paramount is definitely a company in transition, but this valuation dislocation is borderline criminal. On top of this beautiful stock sundae, you get more than 6% in dividend yield just to hold the shares while you wait for the price to normalize, and the short interest is just under 15%.

17,wallstreetbets,ThreeD710,self.wallstreetbets,2,Effects of Inflationary Boom/Bust or Deflationary Boom/Bust on the businesses involved in Energy,"This is a abridged post and is a summary of the following four scenarios –

1. **Inflationary Boom** – increase in prices along with an increase in economic growth
2. **Inflationary Bust or Stagflation** – increase in prices along with a decrease in economic growth
3. **Deflationary Boom** – decrease in prices along with an increase in economic growth
4. **Deflationary Bust** – decrease in prices along with a decrease in economic growth

And how they affect –

1. **Demand for energy**
2. **Investments in energy**

These scenarios occur in varying frequency and sequence over short periods (about 5 years) of time, which combine to form a regime. A regime can either be inflationary (increasing prices) or deflationary (decreasing prices) and can last several decades. The last four decades have been deflationary, and the next four, **appear inflationary**.

**Why do the four scenarios matter**\*\*?\*\*

Because the change in prices and economic growth affect the rate of inflation, which in turn affects the interest rate, which affects how much money is in the economy. The amount of money in the economy affects commercial and retail borrowing and spending, leading to an increase/decrease in demand for goods and services. **An increase/decrease in the demand for goods and services leads to an increase/decrease in the demand for energy**.

&amp;#x200B;

**How can inflation and economic growth be tracked**\*\*?\*\* (A few examples)

1. **Headline CPI** – measures the rate of change of inflation on a monthly, quarterly, and annual basis
2. **Rent Inflation** – comprises 32% of the headline CPI
3. **Services Inflation** – comprises 57% of the headline CPI
4. **Import Prices** – rate of change in the prices of goods and services purchased from foreign sellers
5. **Producer Price Index** \- measures price change for commodities sold for personal consumption, capital investment, government, and export
6. **Chicago Fed National Activity Index** \- is designed to gauge overall economic activity and related inflationary pressure
7. **Capacity Utilization** \- used to measure the rate at which potential output levels are being met or used

**Why are we heading to a regime change which will be inflationary**\*\*?\*\*

**Let us begin by quickly summarizing the disinflationary drivers of the last 40 years** –

1. **China** – the country managed to bring over 600 million people into the workforce and out of poverty. This helped improve their lives but also provided cheap labor to the global economy. At the same time, China laid the massive manufacturing and logistics infrastructure which has made it the manufacturing powerhouse that it is today
2. **Collapse of USSR** – led to the migration of cheap labor from Eastern Europe to Mainland Europe
3. **Outsourcing** – exasperated with high inflation from the mid 1960’s to the mid 1980’s, developed economies willingly accepted the idea to outsource or offshore their manufacturing to China
4. **Immigration** – the same reason stated in point 3 led to developed economies opening up to immigration from developing economies which led to wages being driven down
5. **Debt** – Increase in debt (through monetary policy) led to businesses running on the loss-making model as well as increased competition
6. **Technology** – the ultimate disinflationary driver which made the World smaller, expedited exchange and execution of ideas, gaslighted innovation, and increased efficiency exponentially

**Now let us understand which of the above disinflationary drivers can slow down or turn inflationary** –

1. **China** – demography is getting older and wealthier and labor-intensive industries such as apparel and footwear are moving to Vietnam and Bangladesh. Also, it could be possible that new disinflationary drivers such as Vietnam, Bangladesh, and India can fill in the capacity of China.
2. **Outsourcing** – many developed countries have elected or are electing populist governments that promise to bring back the jobs by reshoring their industries. Also, Covid lockdowns and the Russian – Ukraine conflict has shown governments how globalized supply chains are vulnerable and de-risking supply chains to some extent by localizing them would be a strategic necessity.
3. **Immigration** – again, many developed countries have elected or are electing governments that promise or have a mandate in place that caps immigration which would cut off access to foreign cheap labor and talent.
4. **Debt** – many developed countries are running debt to GDP ratios in excess of 100% and any increase in debt through monetary policy would be a very unpopular opinion among the population

**And the new drivers of the Inflationary Regime?**

1. **ESG** – The transition to Net Zero involves a large negative supply shock and mega capex
2. **Inequality** – the disinflationary regime of the last 40 years worked in favor of the capitalists against the labor, and the monetary policies in place since 2008 exacerbated this inequality. The current inflationary period will put pressure on governments to work on closing the gap in inequality, which will further increase pressures on inflation
3. **Fiscal Policy** – governments are already putting money in the hands of the people so that they can weather the inflation or are providing subsidies. Fiscal policy is proven to be inflationary.

&amp;#x200B;

**As this is an abridged version, I have briefly listed the reasons for my base case of an inflationary regime. I believe that we are currently in a stagflation environment and may either remain in a stagflation environment for a while or alternate between an inflationary boom and stagflation.**

**Having said that, I would like to briefly mention a few of my thoughts or rather, my musings. Will post these musings in a Part 2 Post as this post is already long.**

**Will update this post with the link to Part 2 when I post it.**",0.56,1,0,1,dd,2022-11-04T19:58:07Z,ym5osp,t3

This post may seem like a joke, but it's not.

I earn approximately $3500 per year, that's right, not per month but per year lol.

That's why I always wanted to have a lot of money, not to spend on myself, but to give dignity and meet basic needs to my family.

That's when I realized that I should know the rules of the financial market, to play the money game.

I realized that there are a lot of unfair things, such as: The bank would lend me 125x an amount to invest in a stock, but they wouldn't lend me the same amount to finance a house.

So I decided to stop being sad about it, I accepted reality.

* Apple's market value is now higher than that of Alphabet, Amazon and Meta combined.
* The iPhone maker's worth stands at $2.307 trillion, while its tech peers add up to $2.306 trillion.
* Tech stocks have suffered after posting poor quarterly earnings, but Apple dodged a wipeout.

Apple is now worth more than fellow tech giants Alphabet, Amazon and Meta combined, after it ended trading Wednesday with a market value of $2.307 trillion.

At the same time, the market caps of its three tech giant peers added up to $2.306 trillion at the close of trading Wednesday. Google parent Alphabet's market cap stood at $1.126 trillion, Amazon's at $939.78 billion and Facebook parent Meta's at $240.07 billion, Yahoo Finance data showed.

Overall, Big Tech stocks suffered a brutal selloff last week on the back of disappointing quarterly earnings. But Apple's stock has outperformed its peers after it beat Wall Street's revenue and profit forecasts for its fourth quarter.

The iPhone maker's shares soared 8% in the wake of its results. After their earnings reports, Meta plunged more than 20%, Amazon fell about 10%, while Alphabet saw a single-digit decline.

Alphabet, Amazon and Meta's lackluster earnings signaled that demand for digital advertising is flagging. The poorly-received results have helped wipe billions off their market values as their shares fell, and pushed Amazon out of the trillion-dollar market cap club.

Over the past five sessions, Apple's stock has risen 0.16%, while Alphabet has fallen 5.7%, Amazon is down 17.0% and Meta has lost 7.6% over that period.

Despite Apple's achievement, its market cap has fallen back from its $2.193 trillion value at the end of 2021. A series of headwinds — high inflation, rising interest rates, fears of recession and the Ukraine war among them — have meant tech stocks have struggled in 2022 as investors lost appetite for higher risk assets.

47,wallstreetbets,predictany007,self.wallstreetbets,7,Hedge fund Elliott warns of more pain to come after 2022 market rout," 

Florida-headquartered hedge fund Elliott Management believes the global economy is in an “extremely challenging” situation which could lead to hyperinflation.

In a report on Thursday (Nov 3), the Financial Times (FT) cited a letter sent to investors (and seen by the newspaper) that “investors should not assume they have ‘seen everything’” because they have been through the peaks and troughs of the 1987 crash, the dot-com boom and the 2008 global financial crisis and previous bear and bull markets.

The British daily newspaper said the firm, led by billionaire Paul Singer and Jonathan Pollock, added that the “extraordinary” period of cheap money is coming to an end and has “made possible a set of outcomes that would be at or beyond the boundaries of the entire post-WWII period”.

The letter said the world is “on the path to hyperinflation”, which could lead to “global societal collapse and civil or international strife”.

Elliott executives estimated that markets have not fallen enough yet and equity markets could drop more than 50% would be “normal”, adding that they couldn’t predict when that would happen.

They warned clients that the idea that “‘we will not panic because we have seen this before’ does not comport with the current facts”.

They blamed central bank policymakers for the current global economic situation, saying they had been “dishonest” about the reason for high inflation.

They said lawmakers had shirked responsibility by blaming it on supply chain disruption caused by the pandemic instead of loose monetary policy imposed two years ago during the Covid-19 peak.

These divisions will be: Cannabis, Branding and a 3rd to be named later (this division is being created from within). Our plan provides for each of these divisions to be generating revenue by the end of December 2023.

We estimate that we will file the Super 8-K and financial statements within days after receiving the audit for Consolidated Apparel, Inc (""Consolidated""), which is currently producing about $1.2 million in annual revenues and will remove the Company's Shell designation and add revenue to our books. Consolidated has identified several acquisition targets that complement the Consolidated operations, which if assimilated will potentially increase annual revenues. These transactions, if completed will be structured as Asset Purchases to expedite closings.

In July of 2022, the Company issued 598,800 shares of Series B Preferred for 49.9% of GCTR Management, LLC (""GCTR""), a management company in the cannabis sector in California with two clients. GCTR currently grosses revenues of approximately $300,000 per month. We have an option to purchase the remaining 50.1% percent but will look to extend that date until the end of 2023, so we can pursue other opportunities to increase our presence in the cannabis sector in California. We will continually seek new acquisitions to potentially increase our revenues and will look to lock down 49.9% of two other entities with options to acquire the remaining portion by the end of 2023.

We have agreed to work on new projects with our partners in California with each side owning 50%.

Our new division is being set up from within services of a sector our management has decades of experience in, which we are planning to roll out during the 4th quarter of 2022.

Additionally, in the 4th quarter, we plan to begin setting up operations in the Caribbean to expand both our Branding and Cannabis divisions. For our Branding division, we plan to manufacture products on the island to be sold on the island and export products back to the United States. For Cannabis, we plan to acquire the real estate and equipment needed to operate a manufacturing operation. We will not be involved in the day-to-day operations, but plan to receive a monthly fee for the building and use of the equipment equal to 25% of the monthly revenue.

The Company, in compliance with SEC regulations, will use social media outlets like Facebook or Twitter and its own website at [www.igpk.org](http://www.igpk.org/) to announce key information in compliance with Regulation FD.

A new report delivered to Maryland lawmakers this week shows the national market for legal cannabis growing to $72 billion per year by 2030.

A $75 Billion Industry

The report, which was prepared and presented to the work group by Mathew Swinburne, associate director of Network for Public Health Law-Eastern Region of Baltimore, includes information from New Frontier Data that projects steady growth of the nationwide market as current markets mature and new states are added to the roster of legal cannabis states. Growing from $32 billion in 2022, the projection estimates a total market nationwide of $72 billion by 2030. 

“We know that the cannabis industry is a profitable industry,” said Swinburne. “This is a new industry that is filled with economic opportunity and that opportunity is only growing,” he added. “Although this industry presents some significant economic opportunities, communities of color are missing out on this cannabis boom.”

Swinburne told the work group that jobs in the cannabis industry rose from about 321,000 in 2020 to approximately 428,000 a year later. However, the report also notes that 81% of cannabis businesses are owned by white people and 58% of businesses have no employees who are members of minority groups. 

Main benefactors of this growth remain TRULIEVE, VERANO, GREENTHUMB, CURALEAF, CRESCO Labs 

The five largest MSOS - and most profitable - currently operating in USA.

Hip-hop mogul and entrepreneur is acquiring marijuana assets to be divested in merger of Cresco Labs and Columbia Care

Sean “Diddy” Combs has agreed to purchase licensed marijuana operations in three states for up to $185 million, adding a new business to a portfolio that includes fashion, media and spirits.

If approved by U.S. and state regulators, the deal could create the nation’s largest Black-owned and licensed cannabis company. Mr. Combs said he wants to use the business as a platform to increase Black participation in the cannabis industry.

He said he decided to enter the market to help address long-running inequities. Black people have been disproportionately arrested for marijuana crimes, research has shown. They also comprise a tiny percentage of those making money from the legal cannabis market. In the 26 years since California first legalized medical marijuana, cannabis has grown into a $27 billion legal business in the U.S. and is projected to reach $42 billion in annual U.S. sales by 2026, according to data service BDSA.

The recipients of the proceeds - cresco labs and columbia care who are merging - are one of the top five components of MSOS ETF - which includes TRULIEVE, VERANO, CURALEAF, and GREENTHUMB

CEO Harry Vafias Commented

This quarter’s unprecedented profitability growth is solid proof that our company’s strategy is paying off. With the capital recently raised we have managed to grow our fleet, substantially increase our profitability and cash flow and create value for our investors. As a result of having acquired six vessels in the course of ten months, we generated net income of $15.5 million in a single quarter which is 15,400% higher than our profit in Q2 22’ and equivalent to 23% of our current market capitalization; We incurred moderate debt during the quarter, maintaining a healthy capital structure with $42.3 million of debt while preserving a free cash balance available for further fleet expansion of about $92 million. Given the strong market fundamentals and the promising charter rate environment and by taking advantage of our efficient management of our expanded fleet, we believe that we will achieve strong results and generate significant cash flow going forward. However, the valuation of our shares of common stock does not reflect our strong financial performance and capital available to fund our growth prospects.",0.6,3,0,3,news,2022-11-04T07:48:46Z,ylq6u3,t3

This carried into the present, where I do the same, but have more money to waste.

Over the past 2 years I've gambled away around 15k into options, which doesn't sound like much, but keep in mind I'm a 19yr old college kid. My gambling addiction from options also led me to get into actual gambling, playing online blackjack and roulette (and of course I lose everything I put into it).

I spend money on almost nothing else but options/gambling. I've put around 20k into other business ventures like game development or e-commerce but I've lost all of that as well because of course those ventures led no-where.

So I am here now, completely broke with a crippling gambling addiction, losing my mind every single night more and more. The only escape I have from this life is the gym, going there almost every day to distract myself from the pure failure I am.

56,wallstreetbets,c0diiii,self.wallstreetbets,8,The Hindenburg Omen - A Indicator Present When Market Conditions Are Ripe For A Crash,"\*\*\*For those of you interested in technical analysis, this post is for you. Before you read the long post, there is a link with a video that is more up to date on market conditions and shows the indicators in action. I thought this was a good topic for a discussion due to current market conditions.\*\*\*

**The Hindenburg Omen** \- A rare market signal with a foreboding name is telling traders to prepare for a possible significant decline. Invoking the memory of the flaming explosion of LZ 129 Hindenburg in 1937. The stock market “Hindenburg Omen” signal plays on images of a monumental disaster.

It is easy to see why many of such observations preceded the **35%** drop in the **S&amp;P 500** in early 2020 – certainly a stock market disaster by any measure. However, when these signals are present, it may be good practice to form an exit strategy and help mitigate any potential losses. Let’s dig into what this indicator is and why its signals are important warnings for precarious market circumstances. 

What is the Hindenburg Omen?

The Hindenburg Omen is a term used in stock trading where certain market conditions align to form a signal. For instance, it’s a warning that conditions are ripe for a steep market decline. 

What are the market conditions to incite this tumble? Look for the following four conditions all occurring on the same day:

* The number of new **NYSE** 52-week highs is greater than **2.8%** of all unchanged issues.
* The number of new **NYSE** 52-week lows is greater than **2.8%** of all unchanged issues.
* The number of new 52-week highs is not more than double the number of new 52-week lows.
* The **NYSE** Composite Index 50-day moving average is rising.

**These first two conditions are the important ones.**

Having a significant number of stocks making new 52-week highs at the same time. While a significant number are making new 52-week lows, signals an unhealthy market. When markets are well-behaved, most stocks tend to move together. When they do not, we should be warned and either readjust or improve our trading discipline. 

\*\*\***That warning puts us on notice that for the subsequent 30 days after any observation, there is a greater than normal chance of a crash on any one of those days where the McClellan oscillator is less than zero.\*\*\***

A Hindenburg Omen in 2022

Market observers saw some signals of another Hindenburg Omen as the markets started to decline in January of 2022. Whether this induces another crash remains to be seen. But it highlights why it is important to keep an eye out for indicators suggesting a crash. Especially in unpredictable markets. They are infrequent, but when they occur, it can give us an early warning to watch for signs that might corroborate a decline.

In late 2021 and again in early 2022, we saw a cluster of Hindenburg Omen observations, as recently as January 14th. That has put us on warning to look for exactly the kind of selling which we have already observed and the potential for even more. On any day when the McClellan oscillator is below zero, down moves could turn ugly.  

This warning sign will remain for a 30-day period from the last observation. When significant selling follows the omen and then turns the 50-day moving average of the **NYSE** composite index down, as it has in early 2022. There cannot be another, fresh Hindenburg observation until the moving average turns back up. Bear markets often begin with attempts to regain a new high which fail. Often this action can set up fresh Hindenburg Omen signals for a subsequent leg down. If markets do bounce, it will be something to watch for.

There are some who say that the Hindenburg, filled with hydrogen, was destined for disaster.  However, the airship traveled ten times from Germany to the United States without incident before the crossing where it burst into flames, and **36%** of those aboard perished.

**Likewise, not every observation of the Omen ends in a stock market disaster. It is, however, a sign of a dangerous condition.**

I found a supporting video that discusses this signal in detail with examples of charts and how you can set it up on our trading platform.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%. (Stats as of 2022-10-28)",0.82,7,0,7,dd,2022-11-04T02:32:00Z,yljvwz,t3

I've been using equity Options for a couple years to boost yield. Not Robinhood, not even based on WSB, but legitimate income boosting from my own individual research. It started with simple covered Calls, and then I made a few quick bucks with cash-covered Puts. It was some of the easiest money I ever made.

Jim Cramer says that pigs get slaughtered. Unfortunately, I started getting piggish. Jim does have his moments from time to time.

I got a little looser with my Puts, by not having cash to cover in my brokerage account. I have the cash, but it's in Savings. I started making riskier Puts because they had nice premiums. Had to roll a few, even took a few debits, but was overall positive in taking free cash in exchange for a little risk.

My usual tactic was to watch for a symbol to lose 10-20% in a day, wait a day to stabilize, and then sell a Put for another 20% discount. And I'd get 5% annualized yield. They almost always expire harmlessly OTM. Money for nothing. Easy, right?

Some dipped too close for comfort, or even went ITM. No problem, I can roll. Once or twice, I had to open a new nearly-naked Put position to buy out or roll another one. Like paying off a credit card with another credit card. Financial coaches always recommend that kind of behavior, right?

Well, this week, I had 3 of these riskier semi-naked Put positions hit a trifecta. Bad press, bad earnings call, and the Fed Meeting. All 3 plunged 50-80% in days. Far below the Strike. Of the 3, there is really only 1 that I wouldn't mind owning.

Rolling will cost me almost all my gains from the last year, most of which are already invested into other shares that are covering a Call position. So I'll probably have to infuse more cash to buy back or roll at least 2 just to prevent a forced assignment 50% above the share price. Income accounts are meant to withdraw from, not dump more into just to avoid losing even more cash.

Please learn these lessons:

1. Don't sell a Put on a company that you don't want to own.
2. Have the cash in your brokerage to cover it.
3. Don't transact right before Earnings season when it's already a volatile stock.
4. Low volume Options are harder to roll your way out of.
5. Limit your Puts to 1-2 at any given time.
6. Don't be greedy.

Fortunately for me, these are all low dollar mistakes. I set a personal cap at $25 share price to sell a Put, and that saved my hide. Had this happened with high flyers like Meta, I'd be hosed.

Hear me out. FuboTV is reporting earnings tomorrow morning. There's been an uptick on Google searches for Fubo in the past 3 months alongside increased searches in related topics of sports TV subscriptions:

* [https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=%2Fg%2F11c60pfzx6&amp;geo=US](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=%2Fg%2F11c60pfzx6&amp;geo=US)

Compare this to Roku, which did not experience this search uptick. Roku also spent a lot of capital on physical Roku TVs, which the markets punished after its earnings yesterday. Fubo is unburdened by these types of capital expenditures.

* [https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=%2Fm%2F0\_x7l9\_](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=%2Fm%2F0_x7l9_)

Currently, **short interest in FUBO is 24.95%**. With Fubo trading at all time lows, Fubo just has to not report terrible earnings and awful future projections (subscriptions by sports fans are quite resilient to recessions because it's an ""affordable luxury"") for the stock to rally. This domino can lead to a squeeze.

First of Degens I don't like FB which has 2 billion users still a day I also don't care much for mark Z which is either James Halliday  from Ready player one or IOI, I feel its the latter.

https://preview.redd.it/81o9ob4e9tx91.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ec399ad44901de81c8023e2ea495580e954fe9d

\*I don't care for their policies but I do still keep FB because of family and friends, easiest way to find someone, I also Use IG a lot more lately, and whatsapp.

\* I don't care for Z's meta dream currently but I like the cash generating machine and I like todays 2015 valuation. Here is my thesis for long $META.

META dropped -38% in the last 8 days! Which is a +60% upside to OCT 27th prices. I have a feeling funds will be averaging down soon. See charts below.

https://preview.redd.it/wrzy8aklftx91.png?width=1396&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39bfeff5b048823067907033f7fc049ca2535e23

&amp;#x200B;

[META is projected to grow  to record rev in 2023 to 2025 still and just needs to cut spending. ](https://preview.redd.it/yf06wq8patx91.png?width=2110&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01a967cbf7c19800ac2970d23463433cae9e6796)

First of lets talk about why META is down. Obviously when other tech stocks, some of the biggest in the world can drop -20% overnight like AMZN recently did, NFLX -39% overnight it shows we are in one of the most volatile markets ever. Never have we seen such giant market caps drop this much. So this for 1 presents a big opportunity for me.

:Note NFLX has recovered from that -39% overnight drop and is still up 65% since even with the big drop this past week. It recovered 88% in around 4 months time even with the NASDAQ falling -30% since its drop.

https://preview.redd.it/871e3q18ctx91.png?width=1371&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e12efa6bbc5b3e13656784111d463108b1784ec

&amp;#x200B;

The main reason META is down is because of their spending, but many think Meta is spending only on the METAVERSE which is not the case. Their big spending is for the following which will generate record future cash flow with their current ad rev strategy on new platforms.

**Reasons for future Rev growth even in a recession.**

1)Instagram reels fully monetized

2)Whatsapp &amp; Messenger monetization

3) New AI Discovery Engine to make ad targeting more effective with higher average revenue per user.

4) 2.93+ Billion family users fully monetized.

5)An economic downturn recovery &amp; or more spending for ads again.

**Revenue declined slightly because of the following &amp; can rebound quick**

IMO it is Cyclical as number of users are increasing and user time is rising.

1. U.S. Dollar was beating other currencies and Meta gets a lot of ad rev in international markets.
2. A lot of ads from finance have slowed, the highest paying ads, once we sees a rise in market sentiment those ads come back.

3)Instagram and facebook  reels are not being monetized YET which gets 140 BILLION reels played DAILY!, neither is Messenger and Whatsapp.

4)Apples 2021 Privacy changes, Note The New AI discovery engine will fix this for Meta.

5) Mark and management have started record spending currently on infrastructure /AI discovery engine which is what they are spending the most.

6) 2022 expenses $85-87 2023 projected $96 to $101 billion, which Meta can still be cash flow positive but Mark should and could revamp some spending and do this over 2 years vs 1 and the stock could see a massive move up as funds come back.

7) Many funds have far higher averages and IMO could start averaging up.

These funds below have added before the big drop! Algos have likely been selling as well.

https://preview.redd.it/bt0m3axigtx91.png?width=2132&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a82cce52a2e077bf7e6c704278a2e4b463ebda4d

[META is still top 100 revenue generating companies in the entire world ranked at 65 for rev, and 19 out of 7126 for Earnings STILL.](https://preview.redd.it/qbtgcdfdhtx91.png?width=1293&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=863a7752f43c17aea1b9b7d5a40ba6122dc50e3e)

https://preview.redd.it/m8eyumlcjtx91.png?width=1374&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=580994eecdec4c399d2b3772e1f777f973544164

If the meteverse works out this company is projected to 10x to 25x from todays valuations. 236 Billion and could bring in more revenue than the major stocks with massive overheads AMZN WMT etc with META having little overhead.

 Meta has a family of 3 billion users and growing. Starlink from Elon is  helping third world countries get internet and those are new people to  social media. I have a friend a brazilian actress that visited an amazon  tribe and they are using FB and Instagram and especially whatsapp now  on smart phones. Seriously! Billions of more users open up to social  media as Starlink progresses. People only think in their own bubble and  forget there are billions of people that love metas products. 

TLDR: If meta comes out with a revised spending plan the stock could gap up overnight, They could stretch spending over 2 years vs 1. Even if Metaverse does not work out it can easily 3x from here as spending is for AI ad growth with new infrastructure. Funds Should start to average down soon.

Hope you enjoyed this DD. I like buying Undervalued stocks I got in GME at $4.50 and posted here about it. Not saying Meta is going to go up but I am using profits this year to YOLO it.

# Hedge fund Elliott warns of more pain to come after 2022 market rout

Prominent asset manager says ‘hyperinflation’ could spark one of the worst crises since the second world war

The world is on the road to “hyperinflation” and could be heading towards its worst financial crisis since the second world war, according to Elliott Management, one of the world’s biggest and most influential hedge funds.

The Florida-based firm, which was founded by billionaire Paul Singer and manages about $56bn in assets, has warned its clients of an “extremely challenging” situation for the global economy and for financial markets where investors will find it difficult to make money.

An “extraordinary” set of financial extremes that come as the era of cheap money draws to a close “have made possible a set of outcomes that would be at or beyond the boundaries of the entire post-WWII period,” it wrote in the letter, which was seen by the Financial Times.

“Investors should not assume they have ‘seen everything’” just because they have experienced financial crises such as the 1970s bear market and oil price shock, the 1987 market crash, the dotcom bust or the 2008 financial crisis, it added.

Elliott declined to comment.

The group’s warning comes during a dismal year for markets, in which global equities have shed $28tn in value, according to Bloomberg data, and bonds have also tumbled, leaving investors with few places to seek shelter.

The fund manager laid much of the blame for the looming crisis on central bank policymakers, which it said had been “dishonest” about the causes of high inflation by blaming it on supply chain bottlenecks in the wake of the pandemic, rather than on ultra-loose monetary policy put in place at the height of the coronavirus crisis in 2020.

The world is “on the path to hyperinflation”, it said, which could lead to “global societal collapse and civil or international strife”. While such an outcome is not certain, this is currently the direction that the world was headed, it added.

Its warnings come as investors try to assess the economic damage likely to be felt from a rapid series of large interest rate increases in the US and elsewhere, as central bankers race to try to curb soaring inflation.

The S&amp;P has dropped 20 per cent since its peak at the start of this year, while the Nasdaq is down by one-third since its high a year ago.

However, Elliott said markets had not fallen far enough, given the many risks present, and warned of a further reversal of the so-called ‘everything rally’ seen near the top of the bull market of recent years, as sky-high investor exuberance lifted all manner of risky assets.

There are so many “frightening and seriously negative possibilities” that it is hard not to think that “a seriously adverse unwind of the everything bubble” is coming, it said.

The hedge fund estimates a 50 per cent fall from peak to trough would be “normal”, suggesting further large falls to come in major equity markets, although it added it was impossible to know whether or when that would happen.

Elliott, which is up 6.4 per cent in 2022 and which has only lost money in two calendar years since launch in 1977, pointed to a handful of areas of potential stress that could accelerate market falls. It highlighted banks’ losses on bridge financing, potential markdowns of collateralised loan obligations and leveraged private equity as areas of potential risk for markets.

The firm was also critical of investors who believed market falls will always prove shortlived and can be “ignored”.

The idea that “‘we will not panic because we have seen this before’ does not comport with the current facts”, it said.",0.76,53,0,53,chart,2022-11-04T00:53:12Z,ylhggj,t3

If you are a non-virgin, you understand that the sole purpose for investing and trading is to generate returns, to increase the NAV of your brokerage account and to push your net worth in the upward direction. Why? Because it feels good to have the monetary freedom to do whatever the fuck you want, because green GAIN porn is better than red loss porn, and because it is better to look at your account balance and smile instead of twitch in misery. You are here to make money. You are not here to “be right,” — you are here to generate returns, and preferably, returns in excess of the market, in so much excess of the SPY that you are catapulted towards massive capital appreciation (meaningful tendies) before age 80.

The challenge obviously is that it’s extremely fucking difficult to extract money from the markets, especially with an appropriate level of risk. Unless you are a boomer investing with a 50 year horizon, the markets are designed to fuck you over. Markets are difficult and good opportunities are scarce, especially in a bear market environment like we’ve seen YTD. But remember Warren Buffet said “be something when others are something”? Yes, and today is your opportunity.

Right now, an asymmetrical risk-reward investment window is present in ASTS, a company called AST SpaceMobile, where (i) the disruptive technology and scalable commercialization plan are set to create immense value in the coming months, years and decades, (ii) the macro environment allows for a chance to get in *early* into a potential “millionaire maker” name like NVDA or TSLA, and (iii) a contrarian and concentrated bet can provide incredible upside with manageable level of risk.

I am going to spare you impatient people who are already desperately looking for a TLDR from the “generational opportunity” technical thesis but instead show you the swing TRADE SETUP in ASTS that in my mind has a chance of printing money in the next few weeks and months. Three factors: (1) three meaningful catalysts in mid November, (2) continued business plan execution updates, (3) forces from market participants, potentially with better macro tailwinds, could make the ASTS stock spike, consolidate and push upward in a staircase pattern to high levels. Read on.

# 2/ The Background and the Backers

Notwithstanding the fact that Cathie Wood is washed up, disruptive technology wins in the long-term. Not Roku or Zoom but TRUE innovation that propels humankind forward. ASTS pushes forward that kind of technology, aiming to become the first comprehensive space-based cellular service provider, bridging the connectivity gap across the globe by providing high speed internet access to billions of unconnected people, and powering billions of others who move in and out of coverage even in developed markets like the US.

ASTS is launching a network of satellites to provide these services to any mobile device on the planet. That is achieved through deploying and operating satellite “cell towers” in orbit that will cover the entire Earth with 4G / 5G / LTE signal. The technology links directly to any unmodified smartphone, and unlike Starlink, doesn’t require any additional hardware. This monumental step forward in global connectivity is done through launching proprietary 168 BlueBird satellites into orbit and beaming signal through ASTS patented technology.

All sounds dreamy but this achievement means little for ASTS stock without a solid plan for commercialization. ASTS monetizes the technology through B2B revenue sharing agreements with existing global MNOs like AT&amp;T or Vodafone, who already back the company and even have repeated investments in ASTS. These profit sharing mechanisms effectively remove any customer acquisition or CRM costs for ASTS, and open the opportunity for fat free cash flow margins (Transhumanica thinks 90%+ EBITDA margins) after the network is operational.

Right now, ASTS is on path for business plan execution with one of the main hurdles, having the first BlueWalker 3 satellite in space, already complete in September. The BlueWalker 3 is now orbiting Earth at 17,000 mph and is ready to start “unfurling” on November 10th with testing shortly thereafter.

The TEAM: Abel Avellan, Rakuten, Invesat, Vodafone, AMERICAN TOWER corporation.

The guy in charge, the CEO is Abel Avellan. A chad who was founder of another satellite-based communications company EMC that he sold for $550M in July 2016, using proceeds for initial funding of ASTS. He is executing on the business plan with skin in the game with 78M shares (\~$500M currently) and majority of his networth tied in ASTS shares.

Other direct backers that have stakes include **Rakuten, Invesat, Vodafone and American Tower Corporation**. On top of that ASTS has partnerships and conversations with multiple MNOs in different jurisdictions to provide their service through the B2B revenue sharing model once satellites are operational. Quick cap table. Total shares outstanding 183.0M from 10Q as of August 5, 2022.

* Rakuten, American Tower, Vodafone (along w Samsung) did ASTS Series B then PIPE ($230M) investments.
* Mikitani Hiroshi is billionaire Rakuten CEO backing ASTS with a massive stake.
* Transhumanica with a detailed research paper that I highly recommend. They have an interactive valuation model with a $114 current PT.
* BRiley equity research has outstanding $15 PT.
* DB equity research has outstanding $30 PT.
* Barclays equity research has outstanding $15 PT.
* Also people on the ASTS subreddit have provided incredibly detailed research on the technology and the company.

The NON-BELIEVERS:

* Kerrisdale Capital released some bearish seller research if you’re interested in reading a negative scenario case.

# 3/ The Astrology and the Price

As a former SPAC, ASTS first got attention in late 2020 and participated in the high-growth mania of that period, reaching a peak price of over $25 in February 2021. To me, that price action is of little significance as it was fueled by an incredible frenzy in overall markets, which soon deflated and normalized later in the year. The company de-SPACed in April 2021. Since then, ASTS displayed remarkable resilience despite being a high-growth, unprofitable company in a very punishing macro environment, where rising interest rates have caused the valuation DCF discount rates to go up, valuation multiples to go down, acutely hurting stocks that have more expected FCF value in the future.

The market is a mystery and it can price something far from true value for a long time. It’s hard to value ASTS as most cash flow is in the future. To me, if execution is good, I’d just do $5B EBITDA in 2026 and 8x multiple, discounted to today at 20% – we’d see $100+ per share valuation. Of course it’s a bit binary so we have to be aware of the downside risks with execution at zero. Nevertheless the equity research people are bullish including Deutsche Bank, Barclays, BRiley. You can also take a look at numbers at Transhumanica or peruse through spacanpanman’s Twitter with more research and projections summarized neatly.

Deutsche Bank note from August when ASTS spiked on BlueWalker news:

[Deutsche Bank comment](https://preview.redd.it/ntirufb0osx91.png?width=992&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2800afe12df4affb7e6f9bd89f88f695ab84b4e5)

Interestingly, from June 1, 2022 to present the daily return correlation between ASTS and SPY/QQQ has been remarkably low at around 0.38, which I view as a good thing. Less dependent on daily volatility BS from indexes.

ASTS has traded in a huge channel from the lows of $5.50 to the highs of $14.00 since March 2021 to present. Previous multi-year stock “winners” they all came out of incredibly long consolidation bases which we observe here.

[ TradingView chart of ASTS, 1W ](https://preview.redd.it/dliwwerfqsx91.png?width=1813&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f0034d94a9bd64156001576681377529e74819c)

ASTS year-to-date performance as of October 26 is around -22.8%, compared to the QQQ -34.3%. For a high growth stock, it shows incredible strength — compare it with names like ARKK that are down -62.0% YTD, big dog ABNB -45.2% and SNOW -53.8%. This relative strength gives an indication that despite being currently unprofitable ASTS is likely going to be a leader going forward. Strong stocks are often future winners.

Pretty much from early July to mid-August the indexes grinded higher with QQQ up around 20% — during that time ASTS consolidated in a narrow range. After a few catalysts and good reports in early August, ASTS jumped from around $6.5 to around $14 in a matter of a few weeks. At $14 supply zone, the price action slowed and got slammed down with the overall market and sellers, pushing it down with more inflation worries and higher interest rates woes.

Now we are back at the “support” or demand area, at so-called lows where risk-to-reward becomes super attractive.

# 4/ The Dangers of a Bearish Trade and Previous Catalysts

The no-brainer trade this year was to short unprofitable technology and do nothing but watch how the overall market punishes those stocks. That was the “easy” trade on a company like ASTS that sellers capitalized on. The downward adjustment of multiples due to higher interest rates pushed DCF valuation models lower and ASTS price has been sinking. Naturally, sellers use the opportunity to profit from a structural decline where not much can be done really, the tide goes down and takes every ship down with it. BUT, this can be dangerous when a company is executing on the business plan and has positive developments.

This year we had 2 catalysts that showed what can happen when ASTS keeps executing on the business plan.

1. On March 9, 2022 the news came out that ASTS partnered with SpaceX to deliver their satellites to space. That proved ASTS is meaningfully moving forward with its objectives, and resulted in a ferocious seller covering rally that day, where just “riding with tide” as a seller backfired massively. ASTS stock almost doubled in a day: from lows of $6.20 to highs of $11.40. Later, macro pressures set in again, pushing ASTS lower and the “easy” bear trade came back in, sinking all high risk assets.
2. On July 28, 2022 yet another positive news momentum came in with BW3 satellite launch, that forced a lot of sellers to get out of the way. The frenzied rally more than doubled the stock price in a few weeks. Price went from $6.20 to $14.20, then received expected push back and yielded with broad market weakness.

After Kerrisdale released their bearish report in mid-September price nose dived and we visited the $6 “support area” and bottom of the channel. Interesting to note that previous 2 times, the stock launched from around $6.20.

I think right now there is little idiosyncratic movement to the stock, mostly macro pushing it lower, but that is about to change. Now is an optimal time to get in because we are the bottom of the channel and 3 massive catalysts are upcoming next week, hopefully aided by the tailwinds from macro (not guaranteed) and pressures from sellers relenting as company executes.

# 5/ The New LONG Trade and Upcoming Catalysts

We have an ER update call on Monday, November 14. The three main events will serve as proof of company execution and are likely to push the price up in the next few weeks.

1. Unfurling of the BW3 satellite is going to happen on November 10. Successful completion is likely to serve as a big catalyst to the stock. Satellite will open up and become operational and ready for testing.

[Furled](https://preview.redd.it/5y3wecosqsx91.png?width=643&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd2ae1d0649d74a9db5fe749c1856a6d70bd0d6e)

[Unfurled](https://preview.redd.it/ew43yfytqsx91.png?width=651&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=916c4d08e26af04ecfd10f47c8a29ee23fe2dce1)

2. Testing of the satellite should happen shortly thereafter and an announcement confirmation of working technology is going to be an even larger event for ASTS. This will be the proof that technology works with MNOs.

3. Other funding or partnership updates, like 5G Fund providing indication of possible financing to ASTS may happen by the end of the year, as well as getting licenses in new jurisdictions (Japan), or more partnerships with MNOs.

[Comments on ASTS eligibility for being financed by FCC's 5G Fund](https://preview.redd.it/g1iknnuvqsx91.png?width=1093&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83b7a48437c40c0dc87d4b6a3f9a2ab964afeb4f)

One of the arguments of sellers is that company will need additional funding before generating meaningful free cash flow. Currently they do have runway to revenue, and that gets even better if the FCC 5G fund awards capital to ASTS or if price stays at $18+ for a month, where warrants become redeemable for $200M of capital. Moreover, there’s other non-dilutive financing options, but regardless I think they’ll be explored in second half of 2023 or later.

&amp;#x200B;

[From spacanpanman](https://preview.redd.it/co5m5bc0rsx91.png?width=1194&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a1991c6fc6b4ae4c8fef5e73a7840c35434eeac)

The reason why I think the moves up on positive news could be violent is because there will be additional buying pressure from bearish traders to get cover their positions in face of good data.

Once ASTS confirms that these events are successful, stock will likely become favored by passive and risk-averse investors, with institutional funds buying in and momentum/breakout traders scaling into positions. I believe we’ll get to $14 area if updates are positive, and a breakout above that is likely to clean the path to $18+ which I think is going to be the turning point for the company, that will set it up for long term success.

[ASTS 1D timeframe, imaginary price action.](https://preview.redd.it/wrcwev02ssx91.png?width=1814&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c19d086660cb232eff0c4b823b17f25bc91d5f2d)

Disclaimer, Risks:

Past performance is not indicative of future results. This is not financial advice. There are risks of company failing and stock going to zero.

TLDR:

The no brainer trade this year was to short unprofitable technology and just sit tight. But it is dangerous now, especially on a company like ASTS, which is a powder keg that can explode on successful business developments that are to be announced on November 10 and shortly after. Three upcoming catalysts are likely to serve as a repeat of price action in March and August. Although price is artificially suppressed by the macro environment, once that pressure subsides, the stock will stay high and keep pushing forward as company executes.

Positions: 8,000 shares at $6.27

7,wallstreetbets,DaddyDersch,self.wallstreetbets,16,"11-3-22 SPY/ ES Futures, Apple and Tesla Daily Market Analysis","Well the day after the FOMC meeting proved to be pivotally boring. After a pretty exciting pre market with how red we opened (bless up for my over night puts) we after the first 45 minutes of the day held the same about $3 range all day long. With a love volume red day it seems there is a lot of sidelines money right now and we could end up seeing buyers step back in. I am cautiously optimistic for tomorrow bull wise though. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/un24xy0nrsx91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f21e31cb538ba7322c65e8041bc1f095f301074b

The biggest thing that I mentioned bear wise that happened yesterday was that we broke through key 378 support (green channel). I had mentioned that 370.5 was another big area. I highlighted it here to make it a little more clear. You can see that there is a clear resistance/ support line right there. With SPY breaking through and then holding over it all day and closing over it today I am actually looking for an upside resistance test. 

SPY has put in 4 red days in a row now so it could be expected we get a green day. The other oddity to say the least is that SPY closed down -1.02% and the VIX also closed down -2.28%. Usually I would say that doesn’t happen but in 2022 and lately its happening more and more. Despite everything the JPOW said yesterday the fear isn’t rising in the markets. This is either  sign by the VIX that we should continue to be bullish and expect upside or this is a really “cheap” opportunity to buy some longer DTE puts. 

Bulls will want to defend 370.5 tomorrow again and more or less leave it in the dust and completely gap fill 374.76 tomorrow. From there they need to retest the 378 resistance line and attempt to break back into that zone. 

Bears will want to finally take out 370.5 and close below it with hopes of testing 365 to 359.9 tomorrow and into next week. This is the first time we have had a full candle close below the daily 8ema since before CPI. 

Key support- 370.5 -&gt; 365 -&gt; 359.9

Key resistance- 374.6 -&gt; 378

Looking at futures we nicely held resistance at 3770 and were not quite able to break through support at 3705. Bulls will look to retake 3770 and possibly key 3805 tomorrow. 

Bears will look to continue the sell off and seek out 3705 and most importantly 3675 support.

Apple looked incredibly heavy compared to the rest of the market and actually was the worst top 10 ticker of the day just barely beating out Google. Interestingly enough Apple is only $3 away from its after hours low of 136 on earnings day. 

Now that Apple is back at the 138.2 support area this is where we can look for it to bounce if it is going to bounce. However, something to keep in mind is that unlike tesla and other stocks Apple has NOT put in its 2nd 52week low… this very well could be its attempt at doing so. 

We have a nice black downward channel inside of a falling wedge that also have a falling wedge inside of the black channel… lol yes I know right?

Tesla continues to be all over the place. We did see it break through that “mid” point of 215 today however it was able to find support nicely at 210. However, it did break through the 2 day drop resistance line it was not able to break through and take out the daily 8ema this morning and had a pretty strong rejection there. I will be looking to see if Tesla finds support here with this doji on a downrend which can lead to an upside recovery or if it will indeed retest 205.6 support tomorrow.

The VIX just absolutely continues to unwind here and doesn’t seem to be phased by anything at all anymore. What will cause the VIX to spike and revery back to the 28-30+ range? Honestly im not sure at this point. The really only big bear event ahead is CPI next Thursday but besides that we have nothing till December. December actually is doing to be a Doozy with CPI on a Tuesday immediately followed the next day by FOMC. 

This CPI still does not have a consensus out… which gives me the same type of vibes from last September CPI which could result in a bigger sell off again. I wouldnt be surprised to see a short rally tomorrow till next week. Markets are looking for that “oh wow yeah lets sell” reason again and I don’t forsee one till CPI. CPI most likely will miss and that’s where it gets complicated. On one hand we know jpow said he isn’t ready to slow or pause… he said inflation aint fixed… so another bad CPI maybe he rockets a 100bps at us? Definitely another 75bps at us… how will markets react? Will we react like September or will we react like October.

We also get to add in the unemployment rate to the mix tomorrow if you remember last month when this hit we had an incredibly red open when this news hits the market.

I am still playing to start the 2.5k challenge… I am refining my strategy on the rules and deciding if I wanna do 2.5k per trade or do a 5k account one trade a day for 10%/ 20% stop loss challenge. I am undecided and will think about it this weekend more.

BOE has mentioned Russia's invasion as the cause of inflation in half their bullet points. [(source)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug4qOZ_ZGus)

BOE knew this was going to happen. They forewarned their citizens of electricity and gas shortages last year before the war broke out.

And not just BOE, the FED has also mentioned the war as a leading factor. [(source)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT2H9iyd-ms)

IF true, and a big if.

Putin's course of action is to play the war out as long as possible win or lose irrelevant, as along as it provide an excuse to bomb pipelines (DONE), and participate in predatory market practices (DONE), and break economic agreements (DONE). Russia doesn't need boots on American soil when he can simply have the central banks do the job for him.

This is a well played out market manipulation on the futures markets and he's causing ripples across the globe and to Russia's benefit.

46,wallstreetbets,predictany007,self.wallstreetbets,10,"Netflix ad tier debuts at 'a pivotal moment for the industry,' ad exec explains","Netflix's (NFLX) ad-supported tier officially arrives in the United States on Thursday.

The ad plan, dubbed ""Basic with Ads,"" will cost $6.99 a month in the U.S. — just below Disney's ad-based price point of $7.99 (which will roll out on December 8.)

""Basic with Ads"" will complement Netflix's existing ad-free tiers and be available in 12 countries, including the U.S., the U.K., Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, and Spain.

The ad tier will feature an average of 4-to-5 minutes of ads per hour. At launch, ads will run 15 or 30 seconds in length, with some running prior to the start of a program while others will be mid-roll ads.

Wall Street analysts are largely bullish on the profitability aspects of the new ad tier, and advertising experts refer to the debut as a make-or-break moment for the media industry.

""It is absolutely a pivotal moment for the industry,"" Kevin Krim, CEO of advertising measurement platform EDO, told Yahoo Finance, citing Amazon's (AMZN) Thursday Night Football as another watershed moment when streaming, subscription, and ad-supported went to the masses.

Looking back, the executive explained, this ""will be the moment where the vast majority of Americans became crystal clear that there's going to be a new way to get the must-watch TV that they care about — and it's going to be through a subscription-based and an ad-supported business model.""

Amid concerns that Netflix subscribers will trade down to the ad-supported version, Citi Managing Director Jason Bazinet previously told Yahoo Finance Live that he views the introduction of advertising as a lucrative revenue driver.

""It's not a spin down risk — it's a spin up opportunity,"" the analyst maintained, estimating that the company could secure $10 or more in advertising revenue per ad-tier subscriber in the U.S.

Based on me being 15% down on my position (7000 shares @ $4.02) and the 2 hours (maybe 1.5) of ""research"" I've done, I have concluded that this stock is underpriced.

The stock is reeling from the news that CVS has likely pulled a purchase offer, but it seems like everyone has forgotten that Humana $HUM is still looking to buy, always had right of first refusal, and is primed to purchase (still up 30% on the year). Both CVS and Humana are desperate to get more of that Medicare Advantage plan money and are basically fighting to buy the company. CVS reportedly stated in their conference call that they are still looking to get into primary care through acquisitions, and failed on their attempt to purchase One Medical who was instead bought by Amazon. Meaning the ""news"" of their pullout is likely bullshit to get $CANO back on sale for the institutions before the actual buyout. Not to mention the market cap of CANO is $1 billion less than the enterprise value (whatever that means, it seems good). Analyst's lowest forecast is $4.04, still giving this an %18 upside worst case scenario and a buyout could reasonably drive this to $12 if not higher. 

In summation, $CANO is an opportunity for free money.",0.55,2,0,2,dd,2022-11-03T18:41:17Z,yl7kw5,t3

Let me explain my theory on profit vs debt","It’s counter intuitive but many companies don’t want to make profit these days. There are many problems with being profitable. First you have to pay tax on profits. Second making profit is actually difficult. Third if you start to make profit it will never be enough for the market and you can’t sell a story of hyper growth company to pump your stocks.

What companies really wanted is asset appreciation whether it be their stocks or real estate. In world of money printing, cheap debt and fiat system, most asset values always go up in price over time. 

Appreciating assets allows businesses to cash out refinance at lower rates. Unlike profit, this borrowed money is tax free as per IRS. The tax free borrowed money is then used to boost revenues through ads, pump stocks thru buybacks &amp; sustain lifestyle of executives and their sugar babies. 

The ponzi continues because some of the borrowed money is used to pump the asset prices. Declining rates help as well. As the debt servicing costs decline it boosts the asset prices allowing businesses to get new round of cash out refinance, pay down smaller debt with bigger debt and continue the ponzi.

Powell grew up in different world where companies actually relied on profits for their liquidity. Not anymore. Business models rely heavily on cheap debt these days. In fact they prefer tax free cheap debt over taxable profits which requires running an efficient business and not just financial engineering.

Powell doesn’t understand simple fact it was the declining rates of last 40 years and access to tax free cheap debt that provided liquidity to businesses and also allowed them to keep prices low for their consumers and inflation in check.

AT&amp;T is the most indebted company on the market, with this being said the increased rates have put increased pressure on AT&amp;T to reduce their debt to lower the debt service the must pay. I believe that this increased interest rate risk has already been priced in.  My theory is that there is significant value that has yet to be priced into the options chain because there is a significant underestimation as to how much the prices will be positively affected when the lowering of rates is announced and when it occurs. So I with this being said I am currently holding 3 calls that expire April 2023.

TWLO: Twilio, shit company, they've been making gay bears cum for the past year and a half. Their ""guidance"" is that their EPS is going to be twice as low as last qtr (-.215 vs. -.4)I think they are going to do the same this evening after earnings. All of the ""analysts"" that post their predictions on Bloomberg and are bullish have a 1yr return of around -77%... That's Cramer in my eyes and I'm going to inverse that shit. However, looking at the options chain, there has been a huge influx of calls over the past day. Will check later to see how the sentiment goes.

PYPL: Paypal, also making the bears horny and proud. Bullish ""analysts"" have also been losing like a degen here, averaging around -65%. I'm planning on inversing these ""professionals"" as well. I see an influx of puts here and have gone ahead and bought puts myself, will adjust near market close.  
Positions: 5x PYPL 4Nov $72p

SQ: I think SQ is the worst among these so call ""pro analysts"". Those who are bullish average around -78% for the past year! I expect to buy puts, but the options chain has no huge skew. Will check later and open position.

SBUX: The only positive one here. SBUX seems to be making money. Analysts are bullish and have decent returns. I am also seeing a nice amount of new OI on calls. Will check later and open position.

There you go, my fellow crayon munchers. Will update y'all on my final positions. My apologies for not posting the most active options lately, but I have been caught up with earning calls!

* Shares of Airbnb fell more than 13% Wednesday, a day after the company released third-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street’s estimates but fell short on fourth-quarter guidance.
* For the fourth quarter, Airbnb said it expects to deliver between $1.80 billion and $1.88 billion, below the midpoint of $1.85 billion as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.

Shares of Airbnb fell more than 13% Wednesday, a day after the company released third-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street’s estimates but fell short on fourth-quarter guidance.

Airbnb beat on top and bottom lines in its third quarter. The company posted revenue of $2.9 billion, up 29% year-over-year for its strongest quarter ever, and topped analysts’ estimates of $2.8 billion, according to Refinitiv. The revenue increase was driven by stable growth in the Nights and Experiences booked and elevated average daily rates.

But Airbnb provided fourth-quarter revenue guidance of $1.80 billion and $1.88 billion, below the midpoint of $1.85 billion as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.

Airbnb said to “expect a continued, albeit choppy, recovery of cross-border travel to be a further tailwind to future results” as countries around the world continue to recover from Covid lockdowns and grapple with high levels of inflation and rising interest rates.

He previously had a target of $70 per share on Roku.

“We believe in the long-term opportunity for CTV and see Roku’s active account base and operating assets as valuable,” he said in a note to clients, referencing the app CTV that allows users to watch TV. “However, we struggle to value the business given the lack of detail from the company and the warning indicators.”

On Wednesday, the company issued fourth-quarter revenue guidance that was well below expectations, along with a larger-than-expected adjusted EBITDA forecast. Roku did reported a smaller-than-expected loss for the third quarter, but Morris noted those expectations were already slashed as the business has suffered.

He called the fourth-quarter guidance the “primary surprise,” noting it was “well below” prior forecasts and implied revenue declines due to a drop in up-front spending from advertisers. But he still expects the company to beat when reporting fourth-quarter earnings.

Fourth-quarter total net revenue guidance was predicted by Guggenheim to be 1% lower than the same quarter a year ago. The firm previously expected it to grow 4% in the quarter. Ad revenue is expected to decline 5% in the quarter after being forecast to grow by 7%, while total platform revenue should grow 0.5% compared to the 6% growth expected before the earnings call.

Morris said there is concern over the magnitude of the soft cyclical environments impact on advertising space not bought at the “upfront” event.

Meanwhile, he said the company is still operating at a loss and is likely to increase spending if conditions improve. He also pointed to what he called a lack of visibility into the company’s business drivers such as advertising revenue trends, investment goals and profitability objectives that make it hard to predict future performance.

The stock plummeted 19% in premarket trading following the earnings release Wednesday. Roku has taken a beating this year, losing more than 76.2% through Wednesday’s close.

Uber's total gross bookings were $29.12 billion, slightly below expectations of $29.67 billion. But the company expects total fourth-quarter bookings to rise 23% to 27% from a year earlier. Uber also gave its fourth-quarter profit before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) guidance range of $600 million to $630 million. Wall Street was expecting $567 million.

Meanwhile, UBER also sees positive comments from Evercore ISI’s Tech analyst Mark Mahaney and Wedbush’s analyst Dan Ives. According to Mark Mahaney, Uber is part of the $2 trillion global ride-sharing and delivery market. He thinks the company is on track to grow bookings by about 30% from its current 90 million customers.

""Uber is continuing to see healthy growth as the driver shortage is essentially over while the company continues to benefit from travel returning, shifting to the office, as other post-pandemic trends continue to hold globally with Uber poised to benefit into 2023,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to clients.

16,wallstreetbets,Guilty-Ham,self.wallstreetbets,83,‘Dramatic increase.’ Foreclosure filings are up more than 150%. Here’s what that tells us about the housing market,"The number of foreclosure starts — which is when the first public foreclosure notice happens — is up 219% since the start of the year, according to real estate data analytics firm ATTOM Data Solutions’ midyear 2022 U.S. foreclosure market report. What’s more, the number of properties that had foreclosure filings (this number includes foreclosure starts) is up 153% from the same time period last year. 

Fully 96% of major metro areas saw an annual increase in foreclosure filings, with foreclosure rates highest in Illinois, New Jersey and Ohio. And when it comes to the number of foreclosure starts, California topped the list, followed by Florida, Tennessee, Illinois and Ohio.

“Foreclosure activity across the United States continued its slow, steady climb back to pre-pandemic levels in the first half of 2022,” says Rick Sharga, executive vice president of market intelligence at ATTOM. “While overall foreclosure activity is still running significantly below historic averages, the dramatic increase in foreclosure starts suggests that we may be back to normal levels by sometime in early 2023,” says Sharga. (See the lowest mortgage rates you can get here.)
What does this uptick in foreclosures mean for the housing market?

Foreclosures are shooting up as the various foreclosure moratoriums that kept people in their homes during the worst of the pandemic’s economic disruptions have now ended, explains Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com. That said, they are shooting up from extremely low levels, she adds — noting that even after the sharp increase in foreclosure activity observed in the first half of 2022, we’re still not back to 2019’s low pre-pandemic mid-year total.

“Much like the sharp turnaround in housing inventory that we’ve observed in the number of for-sale homes recently, when the market has tilted in one direction very extremely, we see huge percentage increases when the trends shift back in a different direction, even though in many aspects what we’re witnessing is just a return to something resembling what was once normal,” says Hale.

Indeed, “it’s important to note that many of the foreclosure starts we’re seeing today — in fact, much of the overall foreclosure activity we’re seeing right now is on loans that were either already in foreclosure or were more than 120 days delinquent prior to the pandemic,” says Sharga. Indeed, many of these loans were protected by the foreclosure moratorium put in place by the government during the pandemic — therefore just halting the inevitable by a couple of years. Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate says, “Foreclosure activity is returning to normal levels after being artificially depressed by pandemic-induced payment relief programs and extended foreclosure moratoriums. In a historical context, foreclosures are still very low.”

And while these foreclosure numbers sound dramatic, Holden Lewis, home and mortgage expert at NerdWallet, says it’s not enough to make a dent in the housing market or the overall economy. “Even a healthy housing market has foreclosures, and this pace is nothing to worry about,” says Lewis.
What does this mean for buyers?

While foreclosures remain unfortunate for the owners of those homes, for shoppers who have been frustrated by the lack of homes for sale in their budget, the increase in foreclosures could bring additional options, says Hale. “But much like the increases we see in for-sale housing inventory, it’s just the first step. We would need to see many more months of these increases before home shoppers will feel like they have an abundance of homes to choose from,” says Hale. source without paywall: https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marketwatch.com%2Fpicks%2Fdramatic-increase-foreclosure-filings-are-up-more-than-150-heres-what-that-tells-us-about-the-housing-market-01659181360",0.93,98,0,98,news,2022-11-03T10:01:19Z,ykvrzo,t3

*  The next step might be 50 basis points.
* More hikes are coming.
* The terminal rate is going to be higher.
* Fed is trying to give investors hope by slowing of rate hike pace but not pivoting at the same time.
* It takes 9-12 months for rate hikes to be felt and 12-18 months for the maximum effect. It makes sense to slow down the current pace given we are only eight months past the first rate hike.
* Fed will want slower total and core inflation, pullbacks in house prices and rents, slower wage growth, lower job openings, and likely an increase in the unemployment rate prior to a real pivot.
* Fed is also concerned about the upcoming winter heating season that may cause another spike in energy prices.
* Rate hikes are likely to continue into 2023 in smaller increments.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%. (Stats as of 2022-10-28)",0.78,12,0,12,dd,2022-11-03T04:30:07Z,ykpuun,t3

Listening through the meeting and listening it through it again, I do sense a bit dovishness in his speech. More so than I had originally anticipated looking at the underlying economic data. Caveat to that is it really involves one thing, the rate of increase, not overall Fed Fund rate increase. On the latter, it looks like he's taking that 25 bps and going to push it towards the Feb meeting. I'm overall still bearish for the time being. 

The rate hike that I initially anticipated would be 75 bps for December. It's looking highly more likely that'll it'll be 50 bps. That said, it's looking way more likely that Feb will be 50 bps increase as well in 2023 and will hold it there. That'll push it towards the 4.75%-5% range.

That said, if economic data doesn't improve halfway through this month going past December, I'm thinking they'll keep pushing rates into Q2 2023 most likely in 25 bps range pushing it over the 5% Fed fund rate point. 

Plan your strategies accordingly and expect a bumpy ride. This latest messaging was less clear with mixed economic data coming. 

TL;DR: Swing trade until mid December data. Expect new bottoms to form some time over the next couple months and then hit capitulation in Q1 2023. Will most likely go sideways for most of 2023 with solid recovery going into Q4.",0.86,5,0,5,question,2022-11-03T00:07:26Z,ykj8cn,t3

Powell agreed there wil at some point be a time to slow rate… however, he confirmed that time is not now and it would be pre-mature… The question that will remain now is was this some unbelievably wild over reaction to what JPOW said or did we just witness the top get put in? There is a case to be made for both that’s for sure.

I took the 389C overnight and that was looking rough for a really long time this morning. Thankfully with the rogue pump before FOMC and then the 2pm pump that was expected I exited for a pretty decent win. Not the best exit but when its moving like that it’s the best you can do for sure. 

That pump also allowed me as expected to exit my now 5dte 386C too for almost 20% win.

I did follow my plan of the 234pm calls. I entered and hit 30% profits pretty much instantly… unfortunately that was where the music stopped playing for me. I fully expected based on movement that we were going to see a really big bullish break out on SPY after the 230 presser as historically has happened. However, it dumped pretty much immediately after I entered. I never saw green again and there was no sense to average down or try to do anything silly. 

If you were okay with small profits it did hit, however, if you weren’t fast it turned into a loss.

Someone asked me last night “why don’t you present a bearish case too?” well until today there wasn’t really a reason to present one. What do I mean by that? Well we had been holding this red bull channel for over 3 weeks now. There was little reason to bet against that until we saw like now a breakdown of that support. 

With SPY now breaking through that green channel support of 378.1 and not only that it also rejected the attempted break through of 388.6 resistance I do favor a bearish case now. With the blue resistance line and red bull channel support line there was also a rising wedge formed that has now broken. 

From here we look at our key levels which will be that 378.1 resistance level. If SPY can break back through there and close over that level tomorrow there actually could be a case made that today was some massive over reaction and we are going to see a reversion to mean break to the upside 385 range tomorrow. However, if we back test and reject 378.1 that is even more confirmation of downside to come. 

If you remember since last CPI the media was screaming a fed pivot and a fed slowing of rate hikes. Overall JPOW effectively just said that is NOT happening right now but in the future will happen. With that narrative now squashed where are we going to go next? The next thing on the Agenda is CPI on November 10th which so far we still do not have a consensus on core or CPI yet. However, monthly CPI is consensus of 0.7 which would be a 0.3% rise over previous MoM. I expect that CPI to release soon and I expect that could absolutely move the markets. 

Key support- 374.6 -&gt; 370.5 -&gt; 365

Key resistance- 378.1 -&gt; 379.9 -&gt; 384.1 -&gt; 388.6

Futures does not look any better then SPY and has broken through the red bull channel support also and landed at 3760 support. This will be the next support that bears what to try to take out. Bulls will look to get this back over 3865 by EOW if they want to remain bullish going forward. 

One major bearish thing we can take away here is that this week effectively was a daily 100ema rejection and now huge break down through daily 8 and 20ema. The bearish case is rising in strength. 

Key support- 3705 -&gt; 3675 -&gt; 3585

Key resistance- 3800 -&gt; 3865 -&gt; 3925

Apple actually was the last domino to fall today and even more interestingly about Apple it has officially broken through the bottom from Friday. That huge green day that Apple had on Friday is now completely gone and then some. 

With this bull channel now broken we are looking at downside obviously now too. It is hard to tell in this picture because if I zoomed out too far it would be hard to see the candles but we are actually seeing quite a bit of red. Looking at the daily you can see that 150.6 is the KEY pivot level of bullish vs. bearish and we are seeing a pretty aggressive rejection of the daily 100 and 200ema which I mentioned earlier would take a few trading days to play out. 

Key support- 144.7 -&gt; 141.1 -&gt; 138.2 

Key resistance- 149.2 -&gt; 150.6 -&gt; 153.4 -&gt; 155.4

They really did massacre my girl Tesla today. I was actually impressively bullish on tesla with that closure over key 230 and the candle body over the daily 20ema which fully closing over the daily 8ema. However, we just saw a pretty massive rejection of the daily 20ema today and closure just above key support at 214.9. 

Key support- 214.9 -&gt; 210 -&gt; 205.6

Key resistance- 219.4 -&gt; 225.8 -&gt; 229.9

What would a -2.5% red day on SPY be without the VIX closing barely green at 0.12%... Well I had imagined they were unwinding the VIX for FOMC and especially for CPI next week, however, I would have expected to see a reaction on the VIX especially with this dump. There is clearly still fear and unknown in this market thanks to JPOW today, however, the VIX didn’t really react. Will it react tomorrow? Or is this going to end up being a straight volume dump with VIX once again being detached? 

Daily log- 

Well I am going to start doing these a little differently! I am going to start a 2.5k 10% take profit/ 20% stop loss challenge. So EOD you will see me post my daily log and post results of a 2.55k challenge. I will probably end up making a separate post for the 2.5k challenge also. For me usually my first trade of the day is my best trade so I will utilize my first entry for the trade. I will use the full $2500 per trade (well as close as I can) and I will update this via Excel like my normal port. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1g4jz5ebqlx91.png?width=828&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05a2491de9d015a29655f9088fa96de3697abc0f

I will start the challenge tomorrow just going to move a few things around in my accounts. Now the thing with this is that it is NOT about full porting… that’s absolutely not what im doing this for and $5000 is not a full port for me. What I am doing instead is hoping to show you guys whether its $500, $1000, $2500, $10,000, etc. etc. If you have proper strategy and risk management and take small profits those small profits will add up over time. This is to show you compound growth. Yes one loss of 20% does set you back two 10% wins, but if you continue to trade the $2,500 it adds up and recovers fairly quickly. 

This is not a full port as I said… I will be utilizing $2,500 PER TRADE so as you see above the starting “balance” is $2,500 but that’s not all that is in there. In the future I may do another one of just one trade a day starting with like $5,000 or something in the account and attempt to grow that… the same premise remains though that as long as you maintain a good strategy one loss really only takes 2-3 trades to over come. With premiums being so ridiculous right now it’s a little hard to use less then $2,500 and even some days $2,500 will be a stretch but like I said it will be as close to $2,500 as it can be. 

I will continue to trade normally in my other account doing day traders/ scalps and of course my level to levels.

Not my best day but not my worse day. The important lesson today was no matter how highly probable a trade is… it can ALWAYS go against you and not only that… it is only a high probability trade if we remember to take profits. These trades that are the “big hitters” have to be lotto size and you have to understand that as you see above there is a chance it goes straight to zero.

This week I've accurately used my 3 pre-PDT trades to gain $500 and get rid of this status right before today's shitstorm. I was sitting in cash, 25.2k, just waiting for the FOMC, playing chess and thinking that I'm probably done for today unless market chooses a clear direction after the meeting. Then I see a notification on my phone. YOUR POSITION MAY BE LIQUIDATED.   


wat?  


I opened the app and saw that I'm fucking shorting SQQQ at 52.00 and it's 53.50 now. I forgot to cancel one of the stop orders and went short on margin. I freaked out, tried to cancel the trade via app support and set a buy order at 52.11. Eventually the position was closed at this price and I only lost like $50 on that. And a shitload on neurones.  


After I closed the position, I had a chat with my gf about all the situation, we freaked out, but I felt lucky to escape a potential infinite loss.   


So, happy end, huh? I've evaded PDT status by doing two good trades and dodged this short margin position liquidation.  


Well, after some time I saw a bunch of enormous green dicks on SQQQ chart, realised that market has decided to finally dump and I still can join the trend, bought some SQQQ at 56.00, with default stop loss at 55.00 and profit taker at 57.00. Right after my order was filled, the stonk started to tank. I felt stressed af. It was too much for today and just wanted to exit the trade, fuck off and chill till tomorrow. Instead of closing it with minimal loss, I just watched SQQQ dropped to 55, lost $500, received PDT status, then in half an hour SQQQ jumped to 58, and to 59 in another half an hour. So if I haven't initialised the trade, I would've been +$450 today. If I've sold at a $100 loss, I'd still be fine. If I've managed my stop loss according to volatility, I would've been + extra $1k at close.  


Instead, I'm banned from trading for 90 days. I just watch the market rapidly tanking, feel even more FOMO and self-hatred for being stupid enough to do some emotional trades after such a day and risking my 25k PDT limit. I can't deposit extra money to the account, because my Ukrainian bank doesn't allow me to send USD abroad due to war time restrictions.  


I was waiting for this fucking FOMC and upcoming 52w lows during this whole bullshit rally month, hoping to ride the SQQQ till SPY @ 360. Now I'm fucked, my plan is fucked, finances are fucked. Total loss: $5k. Not as devastating as some of you apes have, but painful enough, and I won't be able to manage this loss in the next 90 days, maybe never, I just feel sick from these fucking candles. Maybe I'll just buy virgin IVW in Feb and maybe will be able to cover my losses in 5 years with the help of cOmPoUnD iNtErEsT. If we won't die in fucking great nuclear war recession till then.  


What a life!

I held strong and had faith in JPOW.

Also, thanks to JPOW I was able to mitigate my losses on my ABNB FD 90 puts.  
I happily sold for only a 35% loss on those; but made 50% on my 100 P FD play (around 7K in profit).

# Final Comment

&amp;#x200B;

AMC is a heavily indebted company; the leverage is unsustainable, and the company is struggling to have positive net income. Its Cash Burning Rate is at 2.56, meaning its spending 2.5 times more its cash availability, giving the company a life expectancy of 30 moths with its current cash &amp; cash equivalents. It will need to cash in accounts receivables to extend more its life expectancy.

Income quality dropped drastically since 2018, it means that total earnings do not correspond to the actual cash intake from its operations.

Cash Ration indicate that the company will struggle to pay its current liabilities with its current cash.

Without  a drastic change in its fundamentals, the company is in high risk.

It is advisable to keep an eye on the Company operations and Management Action and evaluate possible adjustments for the final pricing without any changes in trends, the company is destined to die.

Long term forecast is more pessimistic than previously forecasted. 


IMO they will get interest rates close to core inflation and see how much it slows down inflation. Then they may increase it further for a full on recession to bring prices down by killing the economy. 


If core inflation does start going down through Q4 and early 2023, we will see slower rate increases. If stays high, we're going to 6% very fast.

67,wallstreetbets,predictany007,self.wallstreetbets,12,Fed approves 0.75-point hike to take rates to highest since 2008 and hints at change in policy ahead,"The Federal Reserve on Wednesday approved a fourth consecutive three-quarter point interest rate increase and signaled a potential change in how it will approach monetary policy to bring down inflation.

In a well-telegraphed move that markets had been expecting for weeks, the central bank raised its short-term borrowing rate by 0.75 percentage point to a target range of 3.75%-4%, the highest level since January 2008.

The move continued the most aggressive pace of monetary policy tightening since the early 1980s, the last time inflation ran this high.

Along with anticipating the rate hike, markets also had been looking for language indicating that this could be the last 0.75-point, or 75 basis point, move. Specifically, some Fed officials along with Wall Street economists and strategists in recent weeks had talked of a “step-down” in policy that could see a rate increase of half a point at the December meeting and then a few smaller hikes in 2023.

That language was not overt in the post-meeting statement from the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, though there was a tweak that could point to an adjustment in policy.

This week’s statement expanded on previous language simply declaring that “ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate.“

The new language read: “The Committee anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time.“

The statement reiterated that policy changes “will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.“

Markets will look to Chairman Jerome Powell’s news conference at 2:30 p.m. for more clarity on whether the Fed thinks it can implement less restrictive policy that would include a less dramatic level of rate hikes to achieve its inflation goals.

Along with the tweak in the statement, the FOMC again categorized growth in spending and production as “modest” and noted that “job gains have been robust in recent months” while inflation is “elevated.” The statement also reiterated language that the committee is “highly attentive to inflation risks.“

The rate increase comes as recent inflation readings show prices remain near 40-year highs. A historically tight jobs market in which there are nearly two openings for every unemployed worker is pushing up wages, a trend the Fed is seeking to head off as it tightens money supply.

Concerns are rising that the Fed, in its efforts to bring down the cost of living, also will pull the economy into recession. Powell has said he still sees a path to a “soft landing” in which there is not a severe contraction, but the U.S. economy this year has shown virtually no growth even as the full impact from the rate hikes has yet to kick in.

At the same time, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure showed the cost of living rose 6.2% in September from a year ago – 5.1% even excluding food and energy costs. GDP declined in both the first and second quarters, meeting a common definition of recession, though it rebounded to 2.6% in the third quarter largely because of an unusual rise in exports. At the same time, housing prices have plunged as 30-year mortgage rates have soared past 7% in recent days.

On Wall Street, markets have been rallying in anticipation that the Fed soon might start to ease back as worries grow over the longer-term impact of higher rates.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained more than 13% over the past month, in part because of an earnings season that wasn’t as bad as feared but also amid growing hopes for a recalibration of Fed policy. Treasury yields also have come off their highest levels since the early days of the financial crisis, though they remain elevated. The benchmark 10-year note most recently was around 4.04%.

There is little if any expectation that the rate hikes will halt anytime soon, so the anticipation is just on a slower pace. Futures traders are pricing a near coin-flip chance of a half-point increase in December, against another three-quarter point move.

Current market pricing also indicates the fed funds rate will top out near 5% before the rate hikes cease.

The fed funds rate sets the level that banks charge each other for overnight loans, but spills over into multiple other consumer debt instruments such as adjustable-rate mortgages, auto loans and credit cards.

Listen, Zuck MIGHT be an absolute regard and Meta MIGHT be the downfall of his company, but I hardly believe that’s the case. Take VR-chat for example, I have seen lots of people compare meta with vr-chat pointing out that there already is an existing product that currently, beats meta in regards to graphics and so on. But meta was and isnt meant to be like vr-chat. Vr-chat didnt change gaming or gaming trends in basically any shape or form. We still use our systems and most of us would never switch to vr when we have pc and other standard gaming consoles. So why would meta try to create an already existing product, which has proven to not be very successfull? Well I think the answer is simple, they’re not doing that. The massive spending everyone is constantly reffering to is obviously not spent on the graphics or how it ”looks”, but the engine and the software, that currently (as shown by vr-chat), is very underdeveloped. The product isnt and was never meant to be operational or used right now, but everyone seems to think that because of the massive spending, bad graphics and an unfinished product, meta is DOOMED. I believe that there is profound potential in the metaverse because of the massive spendings, not the other way around. People want groundbreaking technology that potentially could represent reality, but act suprised when it turns out the cost of such a system to be built, is massive. Regarded sheep mindset.

Total revenue was $5.43 billion, up from $3.47 billion in the year earlier. The Street was looking for $4.81 billion.

Rates in have to be above the rate of inflation. 

For example, if you get a mortgage at current rates, about 7% and the rate of inflation is at 8.1%, you are borrowing money at a rate that is lower than inflation, which is not considered restrictive, or that it is stiil cheaper to borrow vs the appreciation of a commodity or asset.

The dilemma that jpow faces, is the time lag theory, which states that for each rate hike, it takes at minimum 6 months for for it to effect in the economy. The totality of  the effects of the rate hikes will really not be known until mid 2023. So no one really knows what the actual effects of hikes will do.

&amp;#x200B;

All apple products are pricey things, including the iPhone, mac, iPad and everything.

Yes they are excellent products with absolutely outstanding performances compared to other products out in the market. Still, yet a LOT of people who buy apple products can save a fortune by picking other products other than the standard MacBook or the iPhone. But yet they have so much market monopoly going on all over the world with such products that will normally be considered quite expensive, to the extent this is almost baffling

&amp;#x200B;

Apple grew AGAIN in the latest quarter
(While all the other major companies mostly had an earnings shock) and I personally think this can only be explained by ""People paying for apple products again and again."" If apple was a growing company aspiring to eat up a lot of the marketplace in the future then the reason for their growth would be pretty obvious. But they're not. It's not like they're starting to insert ads within the ios to increase their revenue. Their one and only source of profit is (mostly) their Apple products. Phones, Laptops, and Tablets that are more than outstanding in quality but also have a significantly higher price tag compared to other products.

It's making people buy the same iPhone again and more (well, not the same but you can still work longer with your previous iPhone.). I don't think Apple would be able to grow this much if people only bought a single iPhone to replace their previous iPhone every three years when their iPhone finally dies.  For some reason they're making the same people buy so much apple products again although their extremely high price tag. Something like buying another iPhone in a shorter span. Or buying other Apple products as well after purchasing your iPhone. Adding a new Macbook in your shopping cart although your previous one is still good.

Seems like people LOVE the iPhone. Yes it's a cult, it's almost something like a new religion

&amp;#x200B;

They don't really have a lot of new customers out there to purchase their first iPhone. Yet the company is still GROWING. A LOT

&amp;#x200B;

Is it the marketing? Is it because of product quality?

21,wallstreetbets,predictany007,self.wallstreetbets,16,Amazon has exited the trillion-dollar club. Sell-off pushes market cap below $1 trillion for first time since April 2020," 

* Amazon’s stock closed down Tuesday for a fifth straight day, falling to the lowest since April 2020.
* Last week the company projected sales in the holiday quarter would be far below expectations.
* The stock dropped 5.9% to $96.79.
* Amazon has exited the trillion-dollar club.

Shares of the e-retailer plunged 5.9% on Tuesday, falling for a fifth straight day and closing at their lowest since April 2020. The sell-off has erased almost all of the stock’s pandemic surge.

Investors continued to punish the company for last week’s disappointing fourth-quarter forecast. Amazon said revenue during the holiday quarter would grow 2% to 8% over the year-ago period, far below analysts’ estimates. The cloud division, Amazon Web Services, also reported weaker-than-expected sales.

It’s the first time Amazon’s market cap has been below $1 trillion since April 2020. The stock has plunged 42% in 2022 and is on pace for its worst year since 2008, when it dropped 45%. The only other year that was worse was during the dot-com crash of 2000, when the company lost 80% of its value.

Like the rest of Big Tech, Amazon has struggled this year due to a slumping economy, soaring inflation and rising interest rates. On top of that, Amazon has been forced to scale back after expanding dramatically during the pandemic, now that consumers have returned to stores.

Amazon has been the second-worst performer in the Big Tech group this year, behind Facebook parent Meta, which has plummeted 72%. Meta told investors last week that revenue in the fourth quarter would likely decline for a third straight period.

Captivating **TL;DR** today - **number go up.** Purchases are u**p 345% ($4.9M to $22M)** from the prior week along with sales, which increased +290% ($263M to $1B). The bulk of purchases stems from insiders at Mobileye Global Inc within the IT sector / Electronic Equipment industry. Active insiders and companies are up 18% and 25% respectively from the prior week.

# High-Level Stats:

* Purchases increased from $4.9M to $22M (+345%)
* Sales increased from $263.5M to $1.02B (+290%)
* Transactions increased from 267 to 316 (+18%)
* Companies represented in Form 4s increased from 170 to 200 (+18%)
   * Net buyers increased from 14 to 23 (+64%)
   * Net sellers increased from 156 to 177 (+13%)
* Insiders filing Form 4s increased from 234 to 292 (+25%)
   * Net buyers increased from 25 to 38 (52%)
   * Net sellers increased from 209 to 254 (+22%)

# Transaction Selection

1. **All** **Direct Open Market Transactions** from **October 24th - October 28th.** These are Form 4 filings with a Transaction Code of “P” or “S”. This narrows the scope to trades where insiders are putting their money on the line.
2. Weekly comparisons are to transactions from **October 17th - October 21st.**
3. **No companies without a ticker** (e.g. opportunity/income/mutual funds).

# Further Context

1. Form 4 data is impacted by a concept known as **backfill** which is par for the course with transactional data. The delay between the Filing Date and the Transaction Date is **\*roughly\*** 2 days and your mileage will vary. This means that **more transactions for past dates can arrive in future filings.** That is why looking at larger trends is key.
2. To combat backfill, filings through this Tuesday are included **\*if\*** the transaction date is from the prior week. Otherwise, transactions from this week are excluded.
3. Data is sourced by the algorithms behind [Form Fore](http://formfore.io/)

# Feedback/Updates

* All feedback, **good bad, and ugly** are welcome - aiming to make these as helpful as possible.
* The **public workbook** should be ready for initial release **sometime next week**. Will also share on Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/FormFore) if that is your preferred hub.
* The newsletter is likely a few weeks out and on my radar. I appreciate your patience!

(TRULIEVE, VERANO, GREENTHUMB, CRESCO, CURALEAF) 

Ontario, Canada-based licensed cannabis producer Canopy Growth’s plans to launch Canopy USA to accelerate its acquisitions of three American marijuana companies and remain listed on a major stock exchange might have provided a blueprint for U.S. companies.

American cannabis operators who touch the plant could follow the Canopy road map to uplist from the Canadian Securities Exchange to the Toronto Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq – provided they’re willing to do a major restructuring, experts told MJBizDaily.

The upside to listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), North America’s third-largest exchange, is that it could help cannabis companies attract more institutional investment.

So far, American plant-touching cannabis companies – such as multistate operators – haven’t been able to raise capital on major exchanges because of the federal illegality of cannabis in the U.S., opting instead to list on the Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE) and over-the-counter markets.

And that might still be a problem, at least for the Nasdaq, which expressed objections to Canopy’s plans and could delist the Smiths Falls-based company.

But the TSX has been more receptive, which could provide U.S. plant-touching operators an avenue for uplisting without waiting for the federal government to legalize marijuana or implement other major cannabis reforms.

In an email to MJBizDaily, Catherine Kee, spokesperson at TSX parent TMX Group, confirmed that Canopy worked directly with the exchange and shared its plans in advance of the announcement.

Kee declined to comment on whether U.S. companies could follow.

“We are aware that legislation applicable to the marijuana sector is evolving,” Kee said. “TMX continues to monitor the developments with interest and we remain committed to supporting the enduring success of the cannabis industry.”

In a note, equity analyst Owen Bennett of New York-based investment bank Jefferies Group wrote that the Toronto Stock Exchange’s approval of a Canopy listing could have major implications for U.S. operators through more M&amp;A by Canadian acquirers and/or enabling “U.S. (operators) to adopt the same structure and uplist to the TSX.”

Restructuring ‘gymnastics’
Kelly Fair – a partner with the international law firm Dentons and external counsel to Canopy’s new holding company Canopy USA – told MJBizDaily she’s proud of the creative approach she and the Canopy team have taken to accelerate U.S. market exposure.

Canopy USA will have a ring-fenced structure in which Canopy Growth would hold nonvoting, exchangeable shares in the holding company, segregating those U.S. assets from the rest of the company.


“To the extent that the substructure is embraced by at least the TSX, then that would provide the opportunity to the U.S. (multistate operators to uplist) potentially sooner than a full legalization event – if they wanted to go through the gymnastics to do structuring like this,” Fair said.

Any MSO looking to uplist would have to create a ring-fenced structure between the listed company and the company that’s actually touching the plant or holding the plant-touching entities, she said.

The pros and cons

Matt Karnes, founder of Greenwave Advisors, told MJBizDaily via email that the TSX is more expensive to list on than the CSE, but that it has more liquidity and more stringent listing requirements – which are both more appealing to institutional investors.

He also said Canopy could try to use TSX approval to pressure the Nasdaq to allow U.S. plant-touching businesses to list.

Another hitch, however, is whether Canopy’s auditors will sign off on consolidated financials that include plant-touching operations in the U.S.

“The Big 4 (accounting firms) have not engaged in U.S. cannabis thus far and this could signal a willingness to accept U.S. cannabis clients – a positive for U.S. cannabis as it gives added assurance to institutional investors as to the industry’s legitimacy,” he said.

Whatever happens, Karnes  believes U.S. multistate operators will follow Canopy’s lead, particularly if they don’t want to wait for legislation such as the Safe and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act that could pass during this lame-duck session of Congress.

“I think whatever path Canopy Growth USA takes, the MSOs will follow, and they don’t necessarily have to wait to see what happens with SAFE.”

35,wallstreetbets,Suspicious-Word-9514,self.wallstreetbets,19,"Macroscope | The Fed meeting preview: 4th 75bps rate-hike is on the way, is pivot coming next?","The Fed's two-day November meeting will end on Wednesday, and the market has well expected its fourth consecutive aggressive 75 basis point rate hike, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. The probability of a 75 basis point rate hike has reached as high as 85.5%, which would raise the federal funds rate to a range of 3.75%-4%, the highest level since 2008.

However, given the recent signals released by the Fed to slow down interest rate hikes, the market is likely to be more concerned about further signals from the Fed after the rate meeting on plans for a December rate hike and the direction of monetary policy next year. The Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has been vocal about the need to slow the pace of interest rate hikes at some point since July, and analysts believe he may also reiterate that point at this meeting. Additionally, a report by the ""New Fed Wire"" last week about the possibility of a slowdown in the Fed's aggressive policy in December continued to gather steam, with medium and long-term US bond yields topping out after hitting yearly highs.

Bloomberg economists said what is less certain is how Powell will communicate a potential future downshift in the rate-hike pace -- the degree of conviction, the risks around hike sizing, and implications for the terminal rate. Economists expect Powell to use 50 basis points present a 50-basis-point move as the base case and clarify that a downshift in the pace of rate hikes does not necessarily mean a lower terminal rate.

It is worth noting that the Fed’s November meeting is also just less than a week before the US mid-term elections. Undoubtedly, how to deal with the Republicans on the high-rise inflation and the risk of recession will become a major problem for Biden. And just last week, two Democratic senators urged Powell not to cause unnecessary pain by over-raising interest rates.

It has been said that there are now major divergences within the Fed on monetary policy. For example, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daley thinks the Fed should start discussions on slowing down rate hikes to avoid sending the economy into an ""unforced slump"". But Kansas Fed President Esther George believes that monetary policy needs to move into a restrictive range, and the strength remains to be watched. Given the recent volatility in the financial markets and the time it takes for interest rate hikes to affect the economy, the Fed cannot act too hastily.

There are also a few views that do not favour a pivot. Fed governor Michelle Bowman hopes to look for signs of falling inflation before slowing down the rate hike. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said he hopes to raise the policy rate to a level that would put meaningful downward pressure on inflation.

Therefore, for this meeting, FOMC members are expected to engage in a heated debate on how to steer interest rates to avoid a troubled economy.

“They may want to go slower just in the interest of financial stability,” said Julia Coronado, the founder of MacroPolicy Perspectives LLC. “It’s a challenge for messaging because they don’t want to ease financial conditions significantly. They need tight financial conditions to keep cooling the economy off. So he (Powell) doesn’t want to sound dovish, but he may want to go slower.”

Some institutions took a relatively cautious view. Nomura believes that the FOMC does not yet seem to have a consensus on the preferred size of a December rate hike, which will limit Powell's ability to provide guidance. The Fed chairman will reiterate that future policy will depend on economic data, including the two non-farm payrolls reports and, most importantly, the latest inflation data. Barclays also released a report saying that the Fed may leave its December policy options open, pending more information on inflation and tightening risks.

The [J.P. Morgan](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NYSE-JPM/) team, on the other hand, made relatively “accurate “predictions on the outcome of this meeting. Analysts believe the most likely scenario going to happen is a 75 basis point rate hike and a hawkish press release, which could allow Powell to retain selectivity for December and next year meetings, while highlighting the current risks of higher inflation. In this scenario, S&amp;P 500 may float between down 1% to up 0.5%. And if the Fed provides clear guidance for the December meeting, this is likely to be seen as dovish and S&amp;P 500 could rise by 2.5%-3%.

In addition, former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers also tweeted recently, saying that the “growing chorus” for the Fed to pause interest rate hikes very soon is “badly misguided.” In his view, the Fed should stick to its current course and not pause too soon, especially given that it has a history of “past errors”.

Aside from rate hikes, let's not forget the glooming recession hanging over the US. Concerns were fuelled last week by the inversion in the 3-month/10-year US bond yields. Prior to this, the 2/10-year US bond inversion had been going on for almost five months. Given the historically extremely high success rate of both yield curves in predicting crisis, there is growing concern about how the Federal Reserve will respond to outside concerns about the economy.

Notably, Jerome Powell had said in the press conference after the September meeting that the goal of fighting inflation had not changed and would be maintained until the task completed, and the federal funds rate would need to be kept at a restrictive level for a certain time. But the FOMC had already revised down the US economic growth rate to 0.2% this year.

It is worth noting that while consumers, the engine of the US economy, are still maintaining spending in the face of inflationary pressures, danger signals are beginning to reveal. The US Department of Commerce said last week that consumer spending growth slowed to a near two-year low of 1.4% from 2.0% in the previous quarter, and consumer purchasing power continues to retreat at a 3% rate and US families are gradually running out of federal financial subsidies in the COVID pandemic.",0.79,11,0,11,question,2022-11-02T14:27:47Z,yk3wmu,t3

Camerco claims:

Uranium inventories are low

Secondary supply is low

Nobody has been investing in supply

‘never started a cycle with this high of a uranium price’

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Camerco appears to be a good steward of capital and understands the market dynamics involved with being a supplier of a not-so-rare mineral

Camerco had \~10% of world uranium production in 2021

China adding \~150 nuclear power plants by 2035

China’s nuclear power generation in the past 10 years has been so great - that it has made up for Europe’s staunch stance on decommissioning - leading to the largest nuclear power plant power generation of all time in 2021. It is conceivable that the west is beginning to realize their mistake and are beginning the process of fixing it, out of necessity from Russia’s and Saudi Arabia’s oil cartel.

Yes, oil manufacturing is going to spike. Oil supply will eventually outpace demand, the Russian war will end, and energy prices will stabilize…but with China investing so much into low-cost energy, will the west want to remain dependent on Russia for economic stability?

Even the most anti-nuclear governments are temporarily halting their decision to decommission 30 year old plants

200 - 400 nuclear power plants to be decommissioned by 2040

Camerco recently announced a deal to buy Westinghouse..

…and Poland just announced they’re building their first nuclear power plant and chose the U.S. and Westinghouse to build their first Nuclear Power Plant.

According to [World-nuclear.org](https://World-nuclear.org): 

About 90 power reactors with a total gross capacity of about 90,000 MWe are on order or planned, and over 300 more are proposed. Most reactors currently planned are in Asia, with fast-growing economies and rapidly-rising electricity demand.

&amp;#x200B;

Major uranium miners are seeing a demand increase in Uranium out to 2024 - and are subsequently significantly increasing production, including Camerco

Many western governments have started initiatives to support nuclear initiatives

Last quarter financial results showed negative earnings because they wrote off the expanse of restarting a mine. They previously shut the mine off due to poor uranium market performance.

Their main competitor is also increasing uranium production. They are both doing so based on contracts they’ve obtained and plan to obtain - neither seem to participate in the spot market in a material way.

&amp;#x200B;

Technically speaking, $CCJ has begun trying to break out of a major downtrend going back to 2014.

$CCJ Reiterated multiple times that they see strong profit going forward, and see production along with spot rates increasing. Given this, the Russian - Saudi oil regime, China's emergence as the nuclear energy super power, a massive reversal in short-term power plant decomissioning, the global incentive to go nuclear (Low long term cost, removal of complete reliance on oil, 'going green'), and  the material fact that Western governments have begun to spend money supporting this thesis...

&amp;#x200B;

Do you guys have any thoughts?

&amp;#x200B;

I'll leave with a headline I found:

Article dated: 6 Oct 2022

# No nuclear power ‘renaissance’ as Europe wrestles energy crisis

""...But after eight months of fighting in Ukraine, and an energy crisis compounded most recently by the alleged sabotage of the arterial Nord Stream 1 and 2 Russia-to-Europe pipelines in the Baltic Sea, European governments long opposed to nuclear power have shown only incremental shifts in their attitudes, which have been informed by years of concerns about nuclear waste and safety.

&amp;#x200B;

A wider pivot has remained absent.

&amp;#x200B;

“We’re not talking about a nuclear renaissance, as such,” Nicolas Berghmans, an energy and climate expert at the France-based Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations (IDDRI), told Al Jazeera, “but maybe more of a change of tide.”

&amp;#x200B;

“A real nuclear renaissance would be if Europe decides to invest in more nuclear power plants.”""",0.76,6,0,6,dd,2022-11-02T10:50:05Z,yjzuta,t3

u/Infamous_Sympathy_91 's [post on credit card debt and personal savings from earlier today](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yjowp1/us_personal_savings_near_historic_lows/)


In 2020 money stopped moving. I wrote this in some of my previous posts and comments. In order to prop up economic activity, central banks increased money supply with almost 0 interest a.k.a Brrrrrr.

So ideally fresh minted money is distributed in the real economy and moves up and trickles down and so forth. As you can see in the chart above, money hasn't been moving as much in the economy since the peak in 2000; It's in constant decline with a hard fall in 2020.

Today central banks are trying to battle inflation. As you can see in the chart above, money isn't moving as much, so it's not that there is too much money in the real economy. Whatever they printed in the last 2 years went up to the big black void of finance. All the derivatives market, swaps, trenches and all sorts of made up bullshit has sucked up money faster than your wife sucking her boyfriend's cock.

Inflation is a product of price gauging and artificial crises, such as cutting down oil production, slowing down logistics around the globe, lagging or harsh response to the pandemic by governments etc.

What you're seeing with the interest rate increases will only hit small businesses and working people. Casino always wins. Banks will own everything. You will own nothing at the end of this.

In the next two years, you will lose your jobs, you will lose your homes if you have debt. You will start selling your assets until capitalism owns your ass. We had reached a point of multi-generational wealth with too many high net worth individuals. Those who are pulling the strings are actively sabotaging the economy and are robbing you.

The interest rates will once again go down, when most people lose everything and you can't borrow anymore. This isn't about bringing the inflation down by decreasing money spent in real economy. The chart in the link clearly shows you that there is no increased activity which would increase velocity of money.

So tomorrow or in the next year don't get your hopes up too much. Your average working class ape is in more debt than before and savings are at an all time low. The latest surge in house prices also guaranteed that banks and through them the central banks owns you.

This is the final stage of capitalism. Good luck to you all.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%. (Stats as of 2022-10-28)",0.8,12,0,12,dd,2022-11-02T03:10:54Z,yjr9oh,t3

So you like to make money fast? Is your motto Lambo or food stamps? This it’s for you. At 2 PM ET FOMC announcement made. A large price movement occurs at this time , this movement creates a fair gap value , as Powell starts to speak at 2:30 ET a counter move starts to test price movement created at release of hike announcement occurs. This can easily 2x-4x your 0 dte SPY option if it goes well if it doesn’t you lose 100% of your initial gamble I mean investment. This same pattern has occurred for the last two years . It doesn’t guarantee that it will happen again. Risky scalp with large potential for profit/losses. Just to reiterate if price has a large move up at 2 pm ET than just before 2:30 ET buy puts, if price has a large move down at 2 pm ET than just before 2:30 ET buy calls .

8,wallstreetbets,DaddyDersch,self.wallstreetbets,48,"11-1-22 SPY/ ES Futures, Apple and Tesla Daily TA","It was the night before FOMC and all through the markets there was oddities… I had mentioned last night actually in my TA that I expect at some point markets were going to get shocked by a big drop intraday instead of this recovery rip… that day was today. 

The interesting thing about today is that VOLD (volume) actually came in bullish at open and through the whole day pretty much until right before power hour VOLD was actually in extreme bull momentum. Now SPY could not break out and break away from 385 level. The thoughts are we either watched markets be held up by volume or there was just some weird stuff going on today. There was some dark pool prints hitting the tapes again today. 

The other interesting thing that I noted today is that this is the first time that the day before FOMC the VIX has been red (and especially didn’t spike) since the June FOMCs. The last two FOMCs were the first with a spike of the VIX the day before. 

What does that mean ? well im not quite sure but those months of FOMC were more bullish. 

&amp;#x200B;

We also have quite a few articles released today saying that Biden supports a pivot of the fed (this was later slightly walked back though). 

My initial thoughts on what to expect tomorrow is that JPOW drops a 75bps (I would be SHOCKED to see a 50bps) but then he should hint at a “we will remain data dependent but there is a case to slow hikes if we continue to see optimism and to fully evaluate the effects of rate hikes.” 

But tomorrow will be interesting to say the least!

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ig9cg0t6hex91.png?width=773&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=358cc3b9af8b4e8c28541c1fa6b63f0f176b3cad

This TA is going to be pretty brief as markets gonna move however the algos want it to with FOMC. 

But overall we did attempt to breakout over 390.1 resistance of the green channel. With that pretty stout rejection we are not finding support which we did find almost all day at 385. This could if we get a green day tomorrow also be seen as a nice daily 8ema/ 50ema support test. In addition I am seeing that the 8ema is crossing back over the 50ema (bullishly) for the first time in two months. 

The rejection at 390.1 also was a rejection of the daily 100ema which im not super surprised by as this level is usually a bigger fight. Markets will need the push from good FOMC news tomorrow to break through these key levels and breakout until CPI. 

Key support- 380.1 -&gt; 377.8 -&gt; 374.1

Key resistance- 388.6 -&gt; 390.1 -&gt; 393 -&gt; 397.8 (my potential target for a bullish FOMC)

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at futures we have actually had this pattern play out just last week where we found support and managed to push up for an extreme green day. 

With a rejection of that 200ema today and that 3925 level that will remain key resistance and we will look for that level to be closed over tomorrow to continue to be bullish. 

Key support- 3845 -&gt; 3800

Key resistance- 3885 -&gt; 3925 -&gt; 3975

Apple has nearly retraced all the way back to where it was Friday before that massive rip on earnings. I wish I woulda been smart enough to short it Friday at market close. Apple was able to back test and hold the daily 8/50ema support lines today, however fell and closed under the 100/200ema. 

Key support- 148 -&gt; 146

Key resistance- 153.4 -&gt; 155.7 -&gt; 157.4

Tesla actually had a pretty nice pop today and broke through (but failed to close over) a key level. I was mentioning as you can see that 205 to 230 red channel on tesla. With this break through I am actually looking at an upside move on tesla (despite FOMC). 

This is its first time its broken through key 230 resistance since October 7th. We still have not closed over 230 though but as long as tesla holds over its daily 8ema and continues to hold this red bull channel I will remain bullish on it. 

Key support- 230 -&gt; 224.8 -&gt; 219.2

Key resistance- 234.2 -&gt; 239.6

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mmpr6qc9hex91.png?width=503&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58c636921894dc187d9689ff9e4c84edfd019809

As I had mentioned this is the first FOMC since June that the VIX has not popped significantly the day before. To me this means markets are bullish. I think that anything super hawkish for the FOMC tomorrow especially if he says 75bps in December the VIX is going to spike like no other and we could very well end up with a huge red day. However, I remain bullish and I think JPOW wont say anything to tip the markets down tomorrow. 

10% challenge-

Overall today was yet again another untradeable day after the first big move. Was able to get some nice scalps in today. And with an average down on my SPY and Tesla puts this morning at open I was able to close the SPY level to level puts for green and close the Tesla level to level puts for a smaller loss (they were very red at open). I don’t like DCAing to win a play like that but I didn’t expect that massive pre-market and with SPY holding under and beginning to dump off the key 390.1 resistance at open I felt confident in the DCA.

\- He found a high correlation between the two in democratic countries that had a free press and independent parties measuring the numbers

\- He found a large discrepancy between the two in autocratic regimes that controlled the reporting agencies and the press (shocker!)

\- Tested his theory against reasons why totalitarian countries might have fewer lights when experiencing massive economic growth (hey! they like working and living in the dark! They're allergic to electricity! They care more about the environment!). Nothing seemed to stand up to scrutiny.

\- Based on the growth in lights, he estimates that China's growth was less than half what they claimed. This means that China's GDP is likely less than half of the US rather than nearly equal

\- The other side of the coin is that their total debt levels might be between 600-700% of GDP rather than 300%

\- Paper has been peer-reviewed and presented at multiple economic conferences

16,wallstreetbets,KoGamer01,self.wallstreetbets,21,Fed Pivot? How I'm Playing it.," 

TLDR- we could go higher but we have more uncertainty in the near future as opposed to the last 2 weeks.

Some important dates to keep in mind:

Nov. 2nd- FOMC day

Nov. 10th- Oct. CPI data

Cant post the chart cus VisualMod keeps on taking it down.

Simple as seeing the last bear market rally and then applying it to now. We saw a rising wedge form on the monthly chart which is happening now. If the fed says it will indeed be ""kinder and gentler"" in any way shape or form you better bet your bottom dollar we will go to 408. However, on the off chance, the Fed says it will continue to bring more pain all your calls will be worthless in a few days. Now keep in mind that Oct. CPI will also determine if we continue to keep going higher even after a Fed ""pivot"". If CPI comes in hot we could see a similar drop back down to 350.

My plan- Wait till FOMC to see if the fed is indeed going to be kinder and gentler. If so buy $400 calls then take out my initial before CPI and if CPI is hot buy $360 puts.",0.62,7,0,7,dd,2022-11-01T21:44:03Z,yjj173,t3

**price\_efficiency:** how much are you losing to the bid/ask spread? Higher number the better. 

**expected\_move:** this is a percentage of the expected move, as priced by the ATM calls and puts, for this stock by expiration date (this Friday)

How to use this in your trading? 

Do you think **DASH** will move more than 14% by Friday? If not, sell options. If you think it will move for than that, I guess you might want to go long (debit) an option (not recommended). 

Do you want to trade **INTC**? Notice how the put\_IV is double that of calls. That means traders are bidding up the puts, and bidding down the calls relative to each other. If you think its going up, sell those puts and buy the calls. 

Want to trade **SBUX**? Realize that you will lose roughly 2% immediately when filling your trade and another 2% immediately when you exit. This is how the bid/ask spread works.

* The comments do not necessarily signal any pending actions against TikTok.
* The Treasury and Justice Departments are the ones leading a review and negotiations with the company.

Shares of U.S. social media companies Snap and Meta spiked on the news that a Federal Communications Commissioner said the U.S. government should ban TikTok.

“I don’t believe there is a path forward for anything other than a ban,” Republican Commissioner Brendan Carr told Axios in an interview.

Snap shares were up 6% and Meta shares were up 4% Tuesday afternoon.

The comments from Carr, one of four current commissioners at the Democrat-led agency, do not necessarily signal any pending actions against TikTok.

The Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS) in the Treasury Department is reviewing the company’s potential national security implications, given its ownership by a Chinese company, ByteDance. And the Department of Justice is the one leading negotiations over a security deal, The New York Times reported in September.

Concerns over TikTok’s potential security risks are generally bipartisan. Both the Trump and Biden administrations have expressed concerns and reviewed the company’s relationship with its Chinese owner. TikTok has maintained that it stores U.S. user data outside of China so that it would not have to turn over that information to the government, but U.S. officials have maintained their skepticism.

“Commissioner Carr has no role in the confidential discussions with the U.S. government related to TikTok and appears to be expressing views independent of his role as an FCC commissioner,” a TikTok spokesperson said a statement.

For those non-gamers out there Turtle Beach is like the HTC smart phone of the gaming headset/accessory market. It is essentially universally hated. Let's remember consumer spending is down, much larger and more diverse competitors in this space are down, tech companies in general down.

**If LOGITECH is hurting TURTLE BEACH is near fatal condition**

This was Logitechs last quarterly report...

Net Income: **-41.13%**

Net Profit Margin: **-33.15%**

Top line revenue: **-12.04%**

This was Turtle Beach ($HEAR) last quarterly report...

Net Income: **-1,135.79%**

Net Profit Margin: **-2,070.78%**

Top line revenue: **-47.43%**

All this being said you must remember Logitech is a much larger company approx. 80 times the size of Turtle Beach. with a **much greater range of products.**

Sounds like Turtle Beach needs to create a much diverse range of products to compete... Well that's exactly what they have been doing although they didn't realize the recession was just around the corner. They have expanded their product line into smartphone gaming controllers, XLR microphones, and flight simulator controllers. I believe/hope that their upcoming quarterly report on 11/3 after market is abysmal. **Just check out the open interest on $7 11/18 PUTS.**

75,wallstreetbets,predictany007,self.wallstreetbets,38,President Biden to float windfall tax on U.S. energy producers. Do you think it will affect energy stocks?," 

* Shares of refiners, oil producers drop after news report
* AP reported windfall tax is being considered by White House

President Joe Biden will call on Congress to consider tax penalties for oil and gas companies accruing record profits, according to a White House official, amid stubbornly high gasoline prices that are dragging on Democrats’ midterm prospects.

This could include a so-called windfall profit tax -- which Democrats have been proposing for more than a decade without success. The idea has renewed attention among progressives in Congress after gasoline prices spiked to more than $5 a gallon this summer.

Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat and Biden ally who chairs the tax-writing Finance Committee, has floated a proposal that would impose a new federal surtax on oil companies that record a profit margin better than 10%.

The White House official didn’t confirm that Biden would specifically call for the windfall tax after AP reported earlier Monday that he would. Biden will press oil and gas companies to invest their profits in lowering costs for Americans, the official said.

The president is scheduled to deliver remarks Monday afternoon, according to the White House, on “reports over recent days of major oil companies making record-setting profits even as they refuse to help lower prices at the pump for the American people.”

Biden also could reiterate his request for Congress to eliminate a slew of tax incentives enjoyed by the industry, including a deduction of intangible drilling costs, which allows oil and gas companies to immediately deduct some expenses, such as labor, site preparation and repairs.

Administration officials have weighed a number of other steps to encourage oil refiners to keep more gasoline and diesel inside the US, instead of exporting it, as domestic stockpiles shrink ahead of winter. New restrictions on the export of finished fuels, including diesel, could be imposed administratively.

Oil industry trade groups have argued a windfall tax would penalize domestic energy and fuel production right when the US should be encouraging more of both.

“Rather than taking credit for price declines and shifting blame for price increases, the Biden administration should get serious about addressing the supply and demand imbalance that has caused higher gas prices and created long-term energy challenges,” American Petroleum Institute President and Chief Executive Officer Mike Sommers said in a statement.

“Today, the president is proposing to raise taxes on the U.S. natural gas and oil industry that is competing globally to produce the fuels Americans need every single day.”

The S&amp;P 500 Energy Index initially erased a 2% gain after the news broke but partially recovered trading up 0.9% at 2:04 p.m. in New York. Refining stocks led the declines.

The Biden proposal resembles measures that politicians across Europe, and in some other countries such as India, are imposing on companies reaping record profits from fossil fuels and power generation. Mostly, those governments are using cash raised from windfall taxes to help subsidize soaring energy bills for households.

Critics of such plans say they’ll deter companies from making the kind of investments that are crucial for increasing supply, and keeping prices down, in the future -- a charge that may have more traction in the US, which unlike most European countries is itself a major oil and gas producer.

According to the SEC’s order, Compass repeatedly assured investors in 2017 that a technology upgrade at its Goderich mine – the world’s largest underground salt mine which is located near Ontario, Canada, and hailed by the company as its crown jewel – was on track to materially reduce costs and boost its operating results starting in 2018. **Compass’s statements were misleading because they failed to tell investors that costs at the mine were increasing rather than decreasing, which substantially undermined the projected savings.** The SEC also found that Compass misled investors by overstating the amount of salt it was able to produce at Goderich.

The SEC’s order found that Compass violated the antifraud, reporting, and internal controls provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and various related rules.

EQT which was founded in 1888, is one of the oldest stocks. The majority of analysts (77%) are bullish on the energy company, and they expect the stock to rally 56% from there. Analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a report last month that ETO-Top's risk-reward setup was the ""best"" among its peers heading into the winter this year.

As Europe’s gas price skyrocketing for the year and oil price globally has risen substantially this year due to the war in Russia and Ukraine providing tight supply. Europe could be headed for tough winters for the next 10 years and the supply shortages are likely the keep natural gas prices on a volatile upswing. The EQT should be benefited from tight supply and strong demand from Europe.

General Motors comfortably beat earnings expectations last week, but revenue was slightly below expectations and it maintained its full-year outlook. Either way, GM reported profits a full 20 percent higher than expected, triggering the rally in GM shares. The stock rose 3.6% on earnings day and is up 6.8% in the three trading days since the results were released.

TDLR: this pump was fueled by Japanese QE, White House is increasing inflation along with Japanese. Fed will be more aggressive to win, we all know the fed don’t lose




so everyone n their mother thinks we’re up because “pivot rumors” reality is when the pivot news dropped, market went green for a few minutes then shat the bed and ran red. then a certain something happened that made us run green and started this rally. It was BOJ interventions. BOJ (bank of Japan) dumped a whopping 40-50 billion dollars that morning so they can save the collapsing yen. Granted they were and partially still in denial about the whole interference as far as I can tell but they do assure y’all that they are “monitoring the markets” and they balance sheet keeps shrinking at a rather rapid pace.

So far off my estimates (too lazy to go pull up balance sheet) but I believe it’s around 200 billion that they have dumped into the markets since “bottom” was in. to put this into perspective, QT is burning slightly under 100bil a month and these guys just wiped out 2 months worth of hard effort and pain that the fed was trying to inflict in around 3 weeks time.

And there’s no sign of them stopping….. 

Their balance sheet is slightly over a trillion so they can keep this going on for a while.


THE CONSPIRACY

This whole operation along with “pivot” rumors are all well too damn coordinated. First off, we won’t see a pivot, CORE cpi was flaming hotter than Japanese pornstars. core PCE while came under estimates; it is still rising and there’s no sign of slowdown. So ask me again, why would they pivot or even hint at a pivot? 
It’s well known the White House has been begging Powell to go easy this meeting because of the election and u bet Powell is not being swayed. If politics were to get involved Powell is a republican and he’s on his last term so if anything he’s delivering more pain. But we all know Powell is here for the American people so I think he’s just gonna do what he had already planned and that is to just do his job and crush inflation. This is his chance to go down in history like Volker did. So I think the White House likley phoned the Japanese and begged them to dump dollars or someshit idk but this was all too well coordinated of a pump. The treasury(White House) is issuing an extra 150bil in debt above estimates. They are all adding to inflation trying to counteract the fed ahead of the elections.


this is why even if Powell had 75bps planned he will be forced to go with 100bps. They can’t increase QT since it’s really very close to max in terms of liquidity drain vs bank reserves. leaving the only option as more aggressive hikes to fight off the democrats and Japanese coordinated attacks against the fed. 


I think even with 100bps it’ll take some time to bleed the Japanese dry if they keep fighting so we can go on for months green if BOJ is willing to drop all 1 trillion that it has but I’m pretty certain they’ll stop once the election ends cuz it is coordinated after all to just spoof the markets for better votes in favor of the democrats",0.75,36,0,36,question,2022-11-01T13:37:05Z,yj6djm,t3

There’s one inflation gauge that bucks the trend

The New York Fed’s often overlooked UIG believes US inflation is past its peak


Whenever there’s an economic consensus on anything, it’s worth considering how it might be wrong. There seems to be general agreement that inflation and rates will be higher for longer, and “team transitory” has been defeated. But what if we are at an inflection point on inflation? This is the question policymakers should be asking. By one key measure, inflation in the US has already peaked. In fact, it peaked in March, the same month that the Federal Reserve began raising the benchmark rate.

The New York Fed’s underlying inflation gauge has largely been ignored for decades. That’s understandable, and not just because of the snoozer of a name. There wasn’t any significant underlying inflation in the years after the global financial crisis. While the Fed and financial markets are fixated on the 2 per cent inflation target, the UIG isn’t primarily a level forecast. Its real value is in predicting inflection points. It correctly anticipated the lasting high inflation we are now observing. And while it’s still high, the UIG is suggesting it will be abating.

The media and the public are obsessed with the consumer price index, while the Fed’s target is based on the personal consumption expenditures index. Both can be “noisy”, since they include the prices of volatile items such as energy and food. But they are not the only price measures. The Atlanta Fed tracks nine other indices(opens a new window) for inflation that aim to strip out noise. They show inflation somewhere between 4.7 and 7.3 per cent in September.

Most of these gauges remove data to try to identify underlying inflation. Core CPI excludes energy and food costs, for example, while trimmed mean and median measures strip out components with the largest changes in prices to smooth out the index. But the risk with these indices is that they can miss large price moves — up or down — that could be a signal of inflation changing direction.

The UIG is constructed differently, removing noise rather than items from the index. The idea is that movements in trend inflation happen alongside related changes in the trends of other economic and financial factors. The index looks at moves in prices, the labour market, financial markets and the real economy every month and checks the historical data going back to 1995 to see if similar moves had previously lasted at least a year. If so, they are included in that month’s UIG and if not, they are filtered out as noise.

You really can’t use the UIG to forecast the level of inflation, as has sometimes been suggested(opens a new window). Where it matters is in showing when the inflation trend is changing, and on this it has a decent track record in both normal and unprecedented times. When CPI hit a peak in 2018, for example, UIG clearly showed the peak while core CPI and trimmed mean and median indices suggested inflation would continue rising. In mid-2009, UIG showed a trough in inflation while the other measures took another year to reach a nadir.
What about during the pandemic? Core CPI did a good job of signalling a bottom for inflation in mid-2020 before rising, but dipped in the third quarter last year, wrongly suggesting that inflation would come down. The trimmed mean and median inflation indices failed to indicate a shift towards higher inflation, showing a trough more than six months after CPI and core CPI.

UIG found a bottom roughly in line with headline CPI and then started a steady climb upwards, rightly ignoring the slump in the third quarter of 2021. Of these metrics, it provided the earliest and most reliable signal for a rise in underlying inflation.

The Fed is now looking for signs that trend inflation has peaked and that monetary tightening is bringing inflation back towards its target. Much to its alarm, core inflation dipped in the second quarter of this year before accelerating in August and September. Median and trimmed mean inflation have been on a steady upward climb, with no signs of stabilisation. But the UIG peaked in March 2022, stabilised at high levels and has been gradually falling since July.

All the different gauges for inflation suggest it is way above the Fed’s target. But we know monetary policy works with long and variable lags, and there is a danger overtightening could spark a recession. The central bank aims to look through transitory factors and set policy based on the underlying trend. The UIG shows the trend is finally starting to reverse course.

**The top 2 challenges  and why they are going in favour of Bayer** 

**1) litgations 2) europe economy**

**European economy and the rise of the germans** 

**The dark winter**
- we all know European is heading into a difficult winter, although energy prices have gone down since i write this, it is no guarantee they will remain so. However, the germans are going to spend there way out of this winter and are poised to avoid a recession in 2023.

*it has already begun*

Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase. 



1) winter recession avoided 

https://m.ca.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/germany-dodges-recession-but-inflation-climbs-to-116-2811016

Why will it benefit the underlying stock? 

Spending - stocks go up in spending times bud. 

2) surprising growth,  will it be enough to outpace inflation ?  For 2023  Germany is likely to be okay, and Bayers product are essentials, during hard times Bayer makes money as well.

https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/short_news/germany-under-fire-for-canibalistic-e200-billion-investment/

3) relief plan makes  the EU  worried, if Germany avoid recession by spending, other European nations will want to follow the idea,  inflation cannot be controlled like this. EU therefore sounds the alarm and potential consequences, it is likely that not too many nations will follow suit in my opinion , Germany can afford to be spending, not many  European nations can, making Germany the exception, in fact if Germany being the biggest economy in Europe  makes it through, much of Europe will also make I through. 

The worried citi suggest the following 

*The proposals could cut 2 percentage points off inflation in the next year, according to Citi, but they are unlikely to prevent an economic contraction. The package “may soften the coming recession but also poses risks, in our view,” Citi analysts said in a note released last Friday.*

Why are we using words like economic contraction  all of a sudden instead of recession? 

https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/07/germany-relief-plan-could-trigger-uk-style-bond-meltdown.html
- **The litigations over roundup** and *glysophate*


 Bayer is still facing litigations due to the acquisition of Monsanto and RoundUp and during the last earnings call, Werner Baumann gave updated numbers. There are about 141,000 claims in total and about 108,000 have been settled.

Remember they have already set the cash aside, have won or litigated the majority of all cases. The rest are likely to head the same path.

Here is glysophate  surging 300% in 2021 https://www.agweb.com/news/crops/crop-production/glyphosate-prices-soar-much-300-and-thats-if-you-can-even-get-it

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic. This includes recent conclusions by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the EU’s Assessment Group on Glyphosate (AGG), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), and the leading health authorities in Germany, Australia, Korea, Canada, New Zealand, and Japan.

36,wallstreetbets,illikwid,self.wallstreetbets,25,How to trade 0dte options on FOMC Wednesday - A Regard's Perspective,"PHASE 0: 9:30-1:59:59

&amp;#x200B;

trading rangebound af.  0dtes swinging +/-10% on pure delta.  theta is frozen.  buy puts on your preferred index/etf at any time.  depending on your risk tolerance and the underlying, open a limit sell order for 1.5x-3x.  pussy with spy itms? get ur +50%.  lunatic on some otm spx? go for that +200% in 5 minutes u fucking god.

&amp;#x200B;

PHASE 1: 2:00:00-2:05 

 

i dont even wanna talk about what to do if its not 75bps but just in case...

100bps: do some sick euphoric dance and start howling.  then remember u set a limit order and lose your mind as you watch your 1.5x turn into free millionaire tickets.

50bps: cry and hope jpow starts levitating and speaking in tongues.  or maybe ur a maniac with a 4100 spx call hedge in case jpow starts handing out bags of cash instead of having a press conference.

&amp;#x200B;

75bps:

instant sentiment analysis on fomc statement finds ""pivot language"" to be largely absent.  spy down 1% in seconds, maybe making it all the way to -2%. your low-return sell order goes off in 10 seconds.  you clench and maybe walk around in a circle for 5 minutes.  your longer shots sell.

&amp;#x200B;

PHASE 2: 2:05-2:33  

&amp;#x200B;

conflicting narratives enter the picture.  the gamma recedes.  hopefully you're back in cash.  maybe you're in shambles cuz ur greedy limit just had its balls tickled.  we catch our breath and say, 'hold on, lets see what pow pows gonna say.  why are we down?  it was 75bps like everyone predicted.  that was priced in.  that was an overreaction, grab up this discounted shit quick.'  

market churns and claws back some to all of phase 1 losses.  pow pow takes his sweet ass time walking up to the podium and clears his throat...

&amp;#x200B;

PHASE 3: 2:34-2:4X

&amp;#x200B;

i dont know really. probably not much happens.  powell on his prepared remarks.  maybe he throws a hawkish jab or two, or sprinkles some grass for the bulls. hold on to ur cash.

&amp;#x200B;

PHASE 4: 2:4X-EOD

&amp;#x200B;

this is where we set momentum into jobs on friday.  powell opens some q+a.  first q probably some random bullshit that pow pow deflects heroically.  then maybe another softball, maybe a few more.  then some legendary lunatic reporter grabs the mic and says, 'YO JEROME YOU FUCKING PIVOTING OR WHAT?' powell takes a moment to collect himself, then states with volume and conviction we shall not pivot.  

now we're at another crossroads.  i'd say market starts selling right the fuck off.  but maybe, just maybe, we irrational bastards are so impressed by jpows stalwart leadership that we collectively decide an economy helmed by such a man must be infallible and head off towards the moon.

you could be in position before this pivotal (fuck you) line of questioning, hoping to predict the market reaction or do a spread if ur into that shit.  or you could wait a few minutes after jpow drops the mic for the direction to become clear and jump on it.  we're not changing direction til mid thursday at the earliest.  i wouldnt even call you a pussy if you bought a thurs / fri exp instead at this point and sold it late on thurs.  if you go with a 0 day roll that shit sometime 3:30-EOD.  

at least 3 percent up or down close on wed and an additional 1-3% move in the same direction on thursday.  

&amp;#x200B;

thats it.  if you made it this far, congratulations! for even considering trading on this perspective, you are now a more degenerate member of society.  even if we strike it big, we're gonna lose it soon or spend it on food accented with gold flakes, caviar, and our own tears.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%. (Stats as of 2022-10-28)",0.83,17,0,17,dd,2022-11-01T02:09:57Z,yitajz,t3

I have lost a lot like a lot of hard earned money in the past couple months. Last week, all I had left was $600, and I was looking on Friday Oct 28th at a Spy call (everyone was saying puts puts) but I just saw it and i was like this call this is it. But cause of all my past losses, I didn’t have the guts to press submit I just didn’t. And guess what, 2000% gains it went up 2000 frickin percent. I can’t believe I had it all was left just submit and at the end of day I could’ve gained 2000%. But I didn’t make it and I got even more scared cause I missed it cause I was scared. 

Anyway, today I was like I am not missing anything cause of fear, and I made two trades, both expired worthless so $600 is gone. 

I am sick of this. And it’s not like I just gamble. I calculate it and go for it, but I feel like the universe against me. Sometimes when I sell to break even it goes up later. And when I am like leave it let’s not just break even it will go up, no it goes down and down.

Thank you to u/80hz14 for posting this in the chat today… as you can see we have a few possible scenarios and outcomes for Wednesdays FOMC meeting. Overall I would say I am in the 75bps hike and a dovish presser where jpow hints at a 50bps in December. I think we should see a 3%+ green day on Wednesday. I would be pretty shocked with rising inflation to see JPOW drop a 50bps but honestly it could happen for other reasons.

Today we saw an extreme small range day (only 39% of the 10 day average) inside day that closed as a gravestone doji. With 388.6 remaining as resistance I will be looking for downside until SPY can break free and close over that resistance level. Today we did see that the 386/ 3880 level on futures was impressively strong support. Any time SPY came anywhere near that we would see a pretty impressive pop. 

Overnight and tomorrow those will be our clear “breakout/ down” levels. From there it depends on which way markets want take us. We very well could end up with an equally as annoying range day tomorrow. However, I wouldn’t be surprised to see a small pullback tomorrow down to the 380 range. The last few FOMCs the two days leading up to it have provided a small pullback. 

Key support- 385 -&gt; 380.1 -&gt; 378

Futures also had an extremely choppy overnight and intraday today. However, its daily char is closing with a double top right at 3910 and just under the daily 100ema resistance of 3925. With holding that key support of 3770 all day today we will look to those two key levels tomorrow to guide us on what direction we are going to be headed tomorrow. 

Its not impossible to believe that markets could rally tomorrow with hopeful whispers of FOMC on Wednesday but the historical trend would point to slight downside (risk off) leading into FOMC.

Key support- 3870 -&gt; 3845 -&gt; 3800

Not much of a surprise after that’s unbelievable Friday that Apple had we had a pretty nice pullback on Apple, although it looks more impressive than it actually was being that Apple only closed down 1.54%. 

Apple is at a key level right here fighting between the daily 200ema of 153.4 and the daily 100ema of 152.2. Historically when it comes to Apple interacting with the 200ema it is a fight that lasts for a few trading days as the daily 200ema on Apple is a major major pivot point. I have not seen too many times where it takes a straight trend line down or up over the daily 200ema. 

Key support- 151 -&gt; 148

Key resistance- 153.4 -&gt; 155.8 -&gt; 157.4

Tesla remains a tricky one to get a good read on, however, as you can see we are maintaining a pretty consistent red sideways consolidation channel from 205 to 230. We have now see our 4th day in a row of Tesla rejecting the daily 20ema and refusing to close over it. However, this is now the 4th day in a row that it has closed over the daily 8ema. As you can see we are in a pretty impressive red bull channel here, however, that blue resistance and red support lines are forming a really nice rising wedge. 

Until Tesla can breakout and most importantly close over the daily 20ema I remain bearish on it. My anticipation would be that we see a move one way or another tomorrow. Key support for that red bull channel is 224.8 tomorrow which is also the 3 day support line and previous resistance line. While its not impossible I would be surprised to see Tesla hold between 230 resistance 224.8 support. 

Key support- 224.8 -&gt; 219.3

I am actually surprised with FOMC in two days to see the VIX unwind more like it did today, however, the VIX actually had a really impressive spike at open and closed down with a nice inside day… one of those odd days where the 10year yield, DXY and VIX were all red and SPY was red. 

Some of the issue I saw today was that over all price action, volume and momentum opened pretty bearish this morning, however, the VIX continued to unwind and I believe that led to a lot of this choppy tight range price action. The VIX is currently holding right at the same level it was prior to last FOMC where the day before fomc closed at a VIX of 27.15. 

Overall no real sense of direction for SPY tomorrow as until FOMC happens the market in my opinion is not going to play nicely and not play by the technicals. 

FOMC day is setting up to be a really nice day for some nice wins, I have posted that TA and trade plan/ analysis. Make sure you give it a read! 

10% challenge-

Today was a really tough day for me today. Actual scalp wise I did do fairly well today, however, I had my level to level calls from Friday that I should have closed the Tesla calls green this morning (regrets) and I actually ended up closing them pretty early this morning when pretty much everything pointed to downside… only for them to pop up right after I closed them. If it wasn’t for those two woulda been a decent day despite the hard price action. 

I also thing that’s something that is going to catch this market by surprise here very soon and possibly even tomorrow for pretty much the last week or two now the price action of SPY in the mornings has been pretty bearish and has also been support by volume too. However, by 11ish we have seen a complete snap of trend and 180 reversal… today just chopped instead of broke out. I wonder if we get a slight sell off tomorrow as people get caught thinking its time to buy the morning weakness.

Closing out my most profitable month of the year and also one that I do not plan to attempt to beat. Great month with some great plays. Keeping in mind that my average % gain per trade was still only 12.7% for the month. This wasn’t so much about getting random massive winners… though I had some nice wins in there too… it was more about consistent small gains that have added up over time and most importantly limiting downside risk with a -20% stop loss. 

I posted my article about that this weekend but something to keep in mind is that just because I use a -20% stop loss on my scalps doesn’t mean that is right for you. You have to find what works for your strategy and your overall profits/ trade. The whole theory is though that you can have an extremely successful strategy but if one loser wipes out all of your weeks profits or numerous days of profits then you need to manage your risk better. It’s a balancing act of having a lose enough stop to not stop out too quickly (especially on my level to level plays) BUT not having such a big stop loss that it hits and the loss takes numerous trades to overcome.

Mostly for my own records but I am going to starts separating my scalps and my level to level trades from eachother and this month of November I really wanna analyze the comparison of them and everything more closely.

87,wallstreetbets,predictany007,self.wallstreetbets,18,JPMorgan Says Dovish Fed Could Spark The S&amp;P 500 To Rally 10% In One Day.,"While hopes for a less aggressive Federal Reserve helped US stocks overcome last week’s flurry of disappointing earnings from tech giants, JPMorgan Chase &amp;. Co.’s trading desk now sees room for a massive rally should policy makers turn dovish when they announce their decision on Wednesday.

The S&amp;P 500 could surge at least 10% in one day if the central bank raises interest rates by a slower-than-expected half of a percentage point, and Chair Jerome Powell signals willingness at the press conference to tolerate elevated inflation and a tightening labor market, according to the bank’s sales team including Andrew Tyler. The scenario is the “least likely” to materialize, yet the “most bullish” outcome for equity investors, the team wrote in a note to clients on Monday.

Laying out every possible scenario on Fed day, the JPMorgan team is embarking on a high-stakes task of predicting market moves based on an event that has largely been positive for stocks this year. Of the six prior meetings, the S&amp;P 500 rose four times on Fed day and fell on the other two, according to Bloomberg data.

To be sure, the bank’s economists expect the Fed to boost rates by another three-quarters of a percentage point, in line with the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey, and Tyler’s team views other scenarios as less likely. Still, the exercise offers a lens into the risks that investors are grappling with.

“These outcomes are skewed to the upside as our view is that last week the market had every reason to retest lows given the disappointment from megacap tech earnings and still moved higher,” noted Tyler and his colleagues. “Several client conversations have focused on trying to identify who is the incremental seller; we think the risk/reward is to the upside.”

Below are the scenarios from the JPMorgan team on how the S&amp;P 500 could react on Fed day.

* 50 basis point hike, with a dovish press conference: “It is difficult to conceive of a scenario where this outcome occurs given inflation levels and a tight labor market,” the team wrote. “Should this outcome occur, the immediate reaction could produce a double-digit one-day return for equities.” S&amp;P 500 up 10% to 12%
* 50 basis point hike and a hawkish press conference: An outcome that could stem from a Fed that is increasingly concerned about financial stabilities as it balances growth and inflation. S&amp;P 500 up 4% to 5%
* 75 basis point hike and a dovish press conference: A scenario viewed as having the second-highest probability of playing out. “If you saw the Fed give explicit guidance for the December meeting, then that is likely viewed as a dovish outcome.” S&amp;P 500 up 2.5% to 3%
* 75 basis point hike and a hawkish press conference: “This is the most likely outcome with Powell retaining optionality for December and 2023 meetings while emphasizing the current risks to inflation moving higher.” The team also views this as the outcome most expected by bond markets, so says there may not be a significant move in yields that keeps equities from melting down. S&amp;P 500 down 1% to up 0.5%
* 100 basis point hike and a dovish press conference: While this is seen as unlikely as a 50 basis point hike, it may mean the Fed both wants a higher terminal rate and wants to complete the tightening cycle this year. “Separately, the market may digest this move as the Fed having prior knowledge of where next week’s CPI prints.” S&amp;P 500 down 4% to 5%
* 100 basis point hike and a hawkish press conference: Considered the best outcome for equity bears waiting for this latest rally to dissipate. “Here this would seem to be a Fed reassessing its own inflation forecasts, which some investors feel is too optimistic.” S&amp;P falls 6% to 8%, likely resting year-to-date lows.

It is nothing more than that, and yet it represents a great deal more. 

It is a piece of paper that vitally affects you and us and the entire financial community. It is also a piece of paper that despite being old and encrusted with a century or more of hoary legalisms has the most amazing, the most appalling reproductive capacity -- it procreates not merely subdivisions of itself but during the course of its life and travels generates an incredible number of relative pieces of paper, that cling to it, describe it, give it directions, authenticate it, transfer it, transform it, cancel it, encumber it. Like all relatives, these attachments are each very different and together very expensive.

The progenitor piece of paper to which I am referring, of course, is the stock certificate.""

A lengthy read, that I'm too lazy to type it all out. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1971/020871smith.pdf)

Why did I come across this, some might ask? 

Well, I was trying to find out when stock market became electronic. Then I was wondering who programmed it.. 

Okay then, why am I curious about who programmed it?

I'm kindly regarded, hugely. But I still wonder things sometimes; If some of you are like me, and have been glued to these charts past 2'ish years - there's a kind of relative thing happening.. I can't quite describe it but as a uh, prolonged barrel-rolling sewing machine pattern, if that makes sense... and it's not 'making' something it's .. well, sort of seeding a landscape we're looking at from top-down..

Which got me to the wondering part, who was it that programmed the NASDAQ initially? 

6oo6ling that specific Q got me nothing so I broke down what I could possibly render a reasonable direction from: computer/software companies in the 60's

A few things stood out to me - IBM, Fortran, and [Harlan Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills) 

IBM because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then. 

"" In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than [4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1946%E2%80%931959:_Postwar_recovery,_rise_of_business_computing,_space_exploration,_the_Cold_War) were IBM machines. ""

&amp;#x200B;

[Fortran](https://emmachev.com/what-is-the-difference-between-pascal-and-fortran-programming-languages/) because it is a procedural, imperative, general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations. After IBM developed it in the 1950s, it soon gained popularity in programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then Harlan Mills. Just look at his timelines and titles. Specifically -  

* Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1975–81

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my thinking.. SEC knew then what we know now. Banks are assholes doing asshole stuff (if you read more of ""A Piece of Paper Revisted"" (see way above). And they figured, well, if we get rid of the human element (to some degree) this might make things more legit for more ppl than less of them. 

IBM is a huge, American computer company. Invest in America, it was the 50's/60's afterall. We were boomin' baby. And they have this Fortran language that handles all kinds of processes. Then we have Harlan Mills - I mean for all what was going on above... he has a suspiciously obvious time gap.. then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth.. pretty sus cuh.

&amp;#x200B;

All right, you've gotten this far in my rabbit hole. 

Along my tinfoil travels, I came across this other dude [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Early_years) \- he apparently influenced Harlan Mills - As an IBM research fellow, Mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development. These included automata theory, the structured programming theory of Edsger Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, and others, and Markov chain-driven software testing.

But what got me in Dijkstra's 'Legacy' section was the [Banker's alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) \- 

The Banker algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an ""s-state"" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

And this is when I came full circle on the part above I was trying to describe at ""I'm kindly regarded."" 

Anyway, this rabbit-hole kinda tripped me out. Figured a share.

Lets review the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November. 

What other macro trends do you think I missed? 

PS. if you don't want to short the market, short TSLA. Its the most obvious play out there.

I'm trying to look at economy news, and learn about things that affect prices of things. 
However I still don't have the knowledge to even be able to have a proper talk about this with somebody or, more importantly, to base an actual financial decision on it.

Our data shows that post and comment removals for new users are a huge deterrent and the reason why many people stop contributing. 

Over the years we've really tried to make it easier to post (some might say it's too easy...) but when things do get caught, the options are few and terrible. 

You can:

1. Complain about mods, say fuck Reddit, and never come back

2. Send a modmail in and at best get a reply 30 minutes later (by which time your submission is dead)

...and that's it.

#Introducing a third option:

3. Hop into a voice channel and immediately speak with a moderator who can reinstate your post

I’m only a year old member of the page, but thought i’d share my thoughts because while this page is fun, it can also be toxic at times and not overly helpful or insightful. That being said, there are plenty of times I have seen positivity and  insight. I’m not a professional at this at all, but thought i’d share my thoughts after my first year of trading options…. But first here was my trade today:

I took a short position (bought puts) on TSLA towards the top of its 207-226 channel this morning. Took 2 contacts at 220ish. 1 additional contract at 223ish. I had my stop loss set, and then went to my actual job. The thesis was that it would get back to 207 support in short to mid term.


 I obviously got very lucky that TSLA severely underperformed today and happened to hit my target. I’ve always hung on to losers too long and winners too short, so i was sure to move my stop to break even when it moved my way, and then continually moved my stop up as the trade worked in my favor. Eventually got stopped out around 206 for $1,710. Felt nice because the risk reward was there, and everything made sense, obviously lucky that TSLA was weak with twitter debacle, but nice to have one go my way.


I’m now long two contracts as you can see above. Thesis is TSLA will return to 220s and stay within this channel in short to mid term. If i get stopped out monday, so be it, but the risk reward for me makes sense.


Things i’ve learned the last year: 


1. I can’t trade 0dte contracts. It’s straight gambling for me and i suck at that. I’m also too busy with my actual job to monitor trades like these which i assume require a high level of attention to detail. 3-4 Weeks minimum preferred for me.


2. The trade has to have a clear out front thesis that doesn’t evolve to fit your bias as the trade plays out.

3. Position sizing is so important for my financial and mental well being. I have to be sure to never risk more than a certain percentage of my portfolio. “Preserve precious capital” as a famous trader says makes sense to me


4. The better my mental and physical health the clearer my mind is with trading.


5. Mistakes happen. Basically blew up my account last fall when beginning options and while i hated myself, it taught me a lot about myself, and my tendencies.

6. I prefer to stick with one stock and listen to a few youtubers i like that analyze it. Simple things like supply and demand level, rsi and macd, and paying attention to fed news and the indices.

I’m not an OG here, but thought i’d share my thoughts and a positive trade i made as i continue to grow and improve. Maybe the mods will remove, idk. TGIF


TLDR: i have learned the hard way about risk management, having a real thesis before trades, and avoiding theta decay/ giving myself time on trades by picking better (in my opinion) expiration dates. Also, if i can’t sleep or feel anxious after the closing bell, i know i am not sizing properly and over risking …

Statistically Speaking, investing in GME has a high probability to give you a return around -5 and 5%, with 43.46% of the data population between -5% and 0 and 45.94% between 0 and 5%.

This gives us a 10.60% chance to get an outlier return from the historical data.

Standard Deviation suggests a 13.11% to ride on a price movement higher than 5% or lower than -5%. In the long run the chance of getting outlier is reduced to 5%.

# Final Comment

With its current amount of Cash &amp; Cash Equivalents and without any drastic changes in the company structure and business model, GME is expected to burn is cash within 35 Months. Taking in mind receivables and other liquidity, it still have 39 months remaining in operation.

The company can avoid this by taking more loans or selling parts of the company and other assets.

Company doesn't pass Acid Test, and it is in a dire financial struggle to survive.

Still expecting negative income and cash flow from operations for 2023.

Debt is not critical, this shall allows some room for a possible long term loan.

Current Cash can cover only 94% of current liabilities. The company should be able to cover it with receivables.

ROE, ROA, ROIC and ROC terrible.

ROE is in recover, so GG

ROIC worsen and ROA is stable

This suggest that, yes the management is trying to fix the company, with some positive outcome, but they are struggling a lot right now.

Income quality getting away from danger zone, but still in bad situations.

Gross profit margin worsened. Company cannot manage well costs, this is probably due to inflation and macro.

There are ""***Strategic and Operational Risks Related to Digital Asset Initiatives""*** *that can have huge positive impact as well as dire outcome if it fails. This is a huge risk factor.*

In the mid term, 1-2 years, the company shall gradually trade down from current price to $15 with possible spikes due to external factors. Expect (90% chance) movements between -5% and 5% cause historical price action with a 10% chance to cash in or go tits up.

Fundamentals point toward bankruptcy, but as for now, if the management play their card well there is a possibility to recover.

With current balance sheet, market  health and macro, the company is fucked up.

consider a stock that has experienced several highs and lows over the last year through both bullish and bearish trending patterns. A technical analyst using a Bollinger  channel may see that the price is approaching its support trendline. If the stock has a positive weighted alpha it can be an affirmation that the stock’s price has largely been gaining over the last year, **supporting another bulish push higher.**


**why is a European Germany company rising its revenue guidance when apparently Europe is gone to sh**t ? You will find out why it is my honest opinion that Warren buffets reasoning to buy when everyone fears is can be applied for Bayer**

The 2022, full year growth outlook raise  is significant, particularly in its crop science division;:

1. Now expecting a 10% previously 5% in the seed and crop protection market for 2022, driven high quality prices for seeds and crop commodities and inflation.

2. Pharmaceutical division to expand by 6% previously 5%

3.conhmsr health 5% from 4% 

**remember this is just by the end of 2022, if the conditions persist the growth outlook widens, it seems like  the basic needs or medication and crops are recession proof when picking the correct company**

If you keep  reading bellow  later,  you ill find out of crop production ever decreased in history.

**The top 2 challenges  and why they are going in favour of Bayer** 

**1) litgations 2) europe economy**

**European economy and the rise of the germans** 

**The dark winter**
- we all know European is heading into a difficult winter, although energy prices have gone down since i write this, it is no guarantee they will remain so. However, the germans are going to spend there way out of this winter and are poised to avoid a recession in 2023.

*it has already begun*

Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase. 



1) winter recession avoided 

https://m.ca.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/germany-dodges-recession-but-inflation-climbs-to-116-2811016

Why will it benefit the underlying stock? 

Spending - stocks go up in spending times bud. 

2) surprising growth,  will it be enough to outpace inflation ?  For 2023  Germany is likely to be okay, and Bayers product are essentials, during hard times Bayer makes money as well.

https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/short_news/germany-under-fire-for-canibalistic-e200-billion-investment/

3) relief plan makes  the EU  worried, if Germany avoid recession by spending, other European nations will want to follow the idea,  inflation cannot be controlled like this. EU therefore sounds the alarm and potential consequences, it is likely that not too many nations will follow suit in my opinion , Germany can afford to be spending, not many  European nations can, making Germany the exception, in fact if Germany being the biggest economy in Europe  makes it through, much of Europe will also make I through. 

The worried citi suggest the following 

*The proposals could cut 2 percentage points off inflation in the next year, according to Citi, but they are unlikely to prevent an economic contraction. The package “may soften the coming recession but also poses risks, in our view,” Citi analysts said in a note released last Friday.*

Why are we using words like economic contraction  all of a sudden instead of recession? 

https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/07/germany-relief-plan-could-trigger-uk-style-bond-meltdown.html
- **The litigations over roundup** and *glysophate*


 Bayer is still facing litigations due to the acquisition of Monsanto and RoundUp and during the last earnings call, Werner Baumann gave updated numbers. There are about 141,000 claims in total and about 108,000 have been settled.

Remember they have already set the cash aside, have won or litigated the majority of all cases. The rest are likely to head the same path.

Here is glysophate  surging 300% in 2021 https://www.agweb.com/news/crops/crop-production/glyphosate-prices-soar-much-300-and-thats-if-you-can-even-get-it

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king: 

Take a look at some of these charts in the past 59 years  have crop production globally  ever decreased over time ? Never, ever.

With crop production increasing, it drags along with it:  Crop Science 


BAYER AG  lifts forcast amid sustained boom in farming prices. crop science unit is major growth engine with price gain.

lawsuit:
Counter point and what investors should know :


For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic. This includes recent conclusions by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the EU’s Assessment Group on Glyphosate (AGG), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), and the leading health authorities in Germany, Australia, Korea, Canada, New Zealand, and Japan.

https://www.bayer.com/en/roundup-litigation-five-point-plan

One of Bayer's core defenses in the litigation is that the EPA has decided glyphosate is not carcinogenic and not a risk to public health.",0.99,8,0,8,question,2022-11-05T02:48:48Z,ymfmmn,t3

I read online that a Form 25 has to be filed with US securities regulator SEC within 60 days of the first issue of proxy soliciting materials for voting on matters related to the buyout. This form certifies that the stock will be delisted by the exchange upon completion of the merger.

On September 02, Zendesk published the first round of proxy soliciting materials. The deal was then approved by Zendesk shareholders during a meeting on September 19. The Form 25 was now most likely has already been filed around November 02.

The Form 25 won't be made available to the public or be ""considered valid"" unless Zendesk issues a press release indicating completion of the deal, and that the exchange has received evidence of a certificate of merger from Zendesk. Upon all conditions being satisfied, the exchange removes the listing 10 days after the Form 25 becomes public. In 90 days, the SEC nullifies the registration of the securities. If Zendesk were to go public in the future, it would be assigned a new CUSP ID.

When a stock gets delisted as a result of a company going private, options are cash settled for the difference between the buyout price and the strike price.

Given that deals tend to be completed within a week of the Form 25 being drafted and confidentially submitted to the SEC, are you guys willing to risk $5 to buy 77 dollar call options expiring 11/11/2022 in anticipation of the deal closing next week?

# TLDR

Zendesk is incorporated in Delaware according to SEC filings.

If the status changes to an L (consolidated), the transaction has went through.

[https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/Ecorp/EntitySearch/NameSearch.aspx](https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/Ecorp/EntitySearch/NameSearch.aspx)

Zendesk apparently has a charitable foundation, and  the status for their charitable organization will likely change from Exempt to M (Merged) one day early before Zendesk Inc changes their status from General to L (Consolidated) .

**FILE         NUMBER ENTITY NAME**

5606971  ZENDESK CHARITABLE FOUNDATION

4661237   ZENDESK, INC.

[https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/Ecorp/FieldDesc.aspx#ENTITY%20TYPE](https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/Ecorp/FieldDesc.aspx#ENTITY%20TYPE)

It apparently costs 20 dollars each time I want to refresh the status of the entity or to check their filing history :(

Changing the status of a company from General to Merged takes about 2-3 weeks apparently, or 24 hours if expedited services are requested.

After getting the certificate of merger between Zendesk Charitable and Zendesk Inc, the company needs to pursue a certificate of consolidation to create a new holding company. When all the documents are prepared, they are sent to the company through snail mail.

If you are checking the site for real time updates, clicking on the link of a consolidated company will likely cause you to be redirected to the original search page.

If you click on any one of the corporations and the unofficial certificate of good standing fails to load, the company's status has also been changed to consolidation. A potential merger arbitrage will be available since return mail does take at least 1 day.",0.99,5,0,5,question,2022-11-04T23:55:35Z,ymbn97,t3

75,wallstreetbets,DaddyDersch,self.wallstreetbets,21,"11-4-22 SPY/ ES Futures, Apple and Tesla Weekly Market Analysis (CPI sneak peak)"," What a wild and volatile end to the week! One of the biggest intraday dumps and recoveries I have seen in a long time and also one of the first times ive seen it with the VIX at such a low level. 

Next week we have election midterms and we have CPI. I will this weekend or next week sometimes post my CPI trade plan to the server but for now here is my expectations for CPI next week after running the numbers. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lets take a little more of a zoomed out look on the daily this time. What do we see? We see that we are still well within that green bear channel of 2022 and are holding right around that red dotted 50% retracement line. We have also formed over the last 2 months now a very sizeable black rising wedge that support was actually reconfirmed on today. We also held the red channel support of 370.6 extremely well today and rejected the 378 channel resistance all in one single day (which is impressive). Effectively we are stuck in this train and rising wedge until otherwise proven. 

Bull case for next week- bulls want to see a midterm election week rally and see a rally into CPI. First step is taking out that 378 resistance and establishing that as support. From there its time to take the red resistance line out from FOMC and look to retest the daily 100ema resistance around 388-390. 

Bear case for next week- with a looming CPI ahead and the FOMC pivot on the pivot this week bears will look to continue to reject 378 channel resistance and eventually break through and close under the 370.5 support and break the support of the black rising wedge. Once that is broken bears have opened the downside to re-test the 350 to 360 support area. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2bfkkd5a30y91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e512c7c006be622548dd43c6fd3a4df6d5346c99

On the weekly timeframe you can see we actually did break the rising wedge that is present from last week. However, we did come down and retest the weekly 200ema and confirmed that as support this week. With this candle body closing inside of last weeks bears and bulls both have an opportunity to break out next week and this could be the start of a bull flag if the bulls can defend 375.9 next week. 

Key support- 375.9 -&gt; 363.6 -&gt; 357

Key resistance- 390.2 -&gt; 408.6

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2jv8guqa30y91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b0221f5520ba291ee83d3caff612c9865da3810

Futures has a similar rising wedge formed with the downside resistance from FOMC. Overall a really nice double bottom and bullishly engulfing candle on futes daily that should provide some upside for Monday next week. Bulls need to retake that 3805 resistance next week early and bears will look to take out 3710 support early next week. Both of these remain key pivot points for futures. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/eufo1b8b30y91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5a7796d72bee08c5cf9213acc44204d9a54b92e

Futures (SPY too really) has a overall macro falling wedge with a blue bull channel that has a blue/ red rising wedge inside of it… yay TA! Overall this was a double top on the weekly at 3910, however, this could easily form into a 3775 double bottom come Sunday night at open and easily lead to an upside push next week. With the weekly 200ema being held once again we should look at upside not downside. 

Key support- 3775 -&gt; 3705 -&gt; 3590

Key resistance- 3910 -&gt; 4085

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gc2wolqb30y91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=60a77eadeef4c232598cc943d91664050aeb060d

Apple had one of the most interesting intradays I have seen on a non major catalysts day in a long time. Apple went all the day down to the October CPI LOD within one penny and someone still managed to rally back and close over 138.2. I actually REALLY would have liked to take apple calls with this closure back over key 138.2 support but it was EOD and too late plus I already had TESLA calls im swinging and SPY I opened instead. 

Apple will look to attempt to gap fill that 145 gap for the bulls and bears are going to attempt to close under 138.2 and put in a new 52 week low. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i9ifx6bc30y91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0cb54a497a1a26685abc6a65cae03b3bf8c0f2b6

The weekly show just how strong this 138.2 support is for Apple and why I was so ready to pull the trigger on calls but was too slow. You can also see that Apple did close back under its weekly 100ema and put In its biggest red week since March 2020 during the COVID crash. 

Key support – 138.2 -&gt; 133.3 -&gt; 129.1

Key resistance- 141.2 -&gt; 147.1 -&gt; 150.8

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5zuvm9uc30y91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b43a51e50533e8fc418a07d6c2c691cb3f289590

Tesla as I had mentioned continues to range in that 205.6 to 234 red channel. I had played some overnight calls on tesla for a huge 47.8% win at open on a 7dte and thankfully closed at open because wow did it get absolutely smacked down. Tesla put in a $20.72 drop from HOD to LOD which was 156% of its average 10day range. A pretty impressive range for Tesla that’s for sure. The biggest thing we have forming here on Tesla is that huge blue/ black diamond and we bounced hard one again off the 205.6 support range. I will be looking for an upside move next week on Tesla and remain bullish especially as long as we continue to hold 205.6 support. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/iztfevdd30y91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3775a029fe4ebe54c829bb59a9c5508c917f74b1

AS you can see on Tesla weekly chart we are still within that downward bear channel and did reject an attempt to breakout over the weekly 8ema. There is also a breakout triangle forming with key level of 224.2 and 207.8 for next week. 

Key supports- 204.4 -&gt; 192.1

Key resistance- 228.3 -&gt; 245

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/157xkwhe30y91.png?width=610&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad41f6767f0490a95c28e16704e60fc6bbd4cee0

We finally saw some volatility with the VIX today with a pretty large rebound spike when we had that huge 1115am dump. However, the vix remains in the downward channel and realistically until we see that resistance broken and see a major major bearish catalyst (cough CPI cough) I wouldn’t be shorting just yet. You COULD start adding slow longer DTE puts like 30-60 dte but I feel you are still early and are just wasting money. WE are also approaching that key 23.6 VIX support area and funny enough before the September CPI we actually were right at the 23.6 support area too. Perhaps we see a pretty bullish three days next week on the markets much like September leading into CPI and then CPI starts the next leg down headed into December. 

Overall I lean for a bullish Monday at least with a possible choppy Tuesday/ Wednesday as markets prepare for CPI but there is a very good chance we could see a pretty impressive green week next week and end up all the back up near 390 before CPI hits. The higher we are the bigger drop I believe CPI could potentially bring for us. 

Daily log- 

This was another amazing week for me. The week really did suck Monday and Tuesday and then after taking that bigger L on Wednesday I was able to recover today and end up finishing the week off going 11 for 11 today with 4 for 4 on scalps and 7 for 7 on level to level plays. Note- a lot of people are inquiring more about my level to level plays so this is something I will once again try to cover and I will make a post this weekend about it I hope. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jshjt4ze30y91.png?width=888&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fccc1c3e198a4ab59265a8fb834330bfc48e8ecd

Interestingly enough… this is now the 2nd week in a row where my level to level plays have netted a greater profit then my actual scalps. This is something I will continue to monitor as time goes forward and I will continue to adjust as time goes on. This week was also extremely tough to scalp as Monday and Tuesday were very untradeable and then Wednesday with the IV spiking was tougher to trade too for big gains. However, with this being the 2nd week in a row with these results I will continue to monitor and see going forward if this trend holds. But for anyone following me who struggles to get in on the scalps while obviously the win rate is no perfect on the L2L plays and never will be with the built in price target stop loss and take profit target (tho I regrettably always take profits early) the profits should greatly outweigh the losses. Definitely something to keep in mind going forward for me. 

Youtube will be up later!  
 

Hope you guys had a great week. See you next week!",0.86,15,0,15,dd,2022-11-04T23:17:31Z,ymaqa7,t3

I’m new to wsb, I discussed my stocks more with friends but they all gave up on trading lol. I made big profits in the last years with Tesla and other tech stuff (about 500%). I was basically a buy and hold investor but started with options some months ago to leverage my portfolio. It did well but I’m less optimistic now. I think the next years will be though and shorting the Nasdaq 100 is still a good move now. But I’ll still hold Tesla and Apple. Maybe some other large caps too - It’s hard to let them go after all those years of profits.

The only thing I’m really optimistic right now is Porsche. It startet only about one month ago and the Porsche family is happily buying back as much stocks as possible. They set a very low price on the stock to buy it back very cheap. I think they secretly want to buy back everything to own it again like in the early 2000s. I’m not sure if they are genius or crazy… Anyway I also calculated a target price of 154€ per share in the short term and expect it much higher if they really want to buy it back. The fundamentals and future are amazing and I bought lots of lots of calls. Maybe some of you have also looked at P911 and wants to discuss it.

I’m happy to hear about your opinions :)",0.5,0,0,0,dd,2022-11-04T21:17:47Z,ym7pet,t3

1.) Paramount possesses the fastest growing streaming offering in the market, Paramount+.

2.) Paramount owns CBS and has the rights to broadcast most NFL games as well as Premier League Soccer.

3.) Paramount Pictures has had a wildly successful year, including the release of Top Gun Maverick, the 5th highest grossing film of all time. 

Despite this, PARA shares are trading at an embarrassingly low valuation:

1.) Price/earnings multiple of less than 8.

2.) Approximately one third price/sales.

3.) Less than half of book value.

Paramount is definitely a company in transition, but this valuation dislocation is borderline criminal. On top of this beautiful stock sundae, you get more than 6% in dividend yield just to hold the shares while you wait for the price to normalize, and the short interest is just under 15%.

20,wallstreetbets,ThreeD710,self.wallstreetbets,2,Effects of Inflationary Boom/Bust or Deflationary Boom/Bust on the businesses involved in Energy,"This is a abridged post and is a summary of the following four scenarios –

1. **Inflationary Boom** – increase in prices along with an increase in economic growth
2. **Inflationary Bust or Stagflation** – increase in prices along with a decrease in economic growth
3. **Deflationary Boom** – decrease in prices along with an increase in economic growth
4. **Deflationary Bust** – decrease in prices along with a decrease in economic growth

And how they affect –

1. **Demand for energy**
2. **Investments in energy**

These scenarios occur in varying frequency and sequence over short periods (about 5 years) of time, which combine to form a regime. A regime can either be inflationary (increasing prices) or deflationary (decreasing prices) and can last several decades. The last four decades have been deflationary, and the next four, **appear inflationary**.

**Why do the four scenarios matter**\*\*?\*\*

Because the change in prices and economic growth affect the rate of inflation, which in turn affects the interest rate, which affects how much money is in the economy. The amount of money in the economy affects commercial and retail borrowing and spending, leading to an increase/decrease in demand for goods and services. **An increase/decrease in the demand for goods and services leads to an increase/decrease in the demand for energy**.

&amp;#x200B;

**How can inflation and economic growth be tracked**\*\*?\*\* (A few examples)

1. **Headline CPI** – measures the rate of change of inflation on a monthly, quarterly, and annual basis
2. **Rent Inflation** – comprises 32% of the headline CPI
3. **Services Inflation** – comprises 57% of the headline CPI
4. **Import Prices** – rate of change in the prices of goods and services purchased from foreign sellers
5. **Producer Price Index** \- measures price change for commodities sold for personal consumption, capital investment, government, and export
6. **Chicago Fed National Activity Index** \- is designed to gauge overall economic activity and related inflationary pressure
7. **Capacity Utilization** \- used to measure the rate at which potential output levels are being met or used

**Why are we heading to a regime change which will be inflationary**\*\*?\*\*

**Let us begin by quickly summarizing the disinflationary drivers of the last 40 years** –

1. **China** – the country managed to bring over 600 million people into the workforce and out of poverty. This helped improve their lives but also provided cheap labor to the global economy. At the same time, China laid the massive manufacturing and logistics infrastructure which has made it the manufacturing powerhouse that it is today
2. **Collapse of USSR** – led to the migration of cheap labor from Eastern Europe to Mainland Europe
3. **Outsourcing** – exasperated with high inflation from the mid 1960’s to the mid 1980’s, developed economies willingly accepted the idea to outsource or offshore their manufacturing to China
4. **Immigration** – the same reason stated in point 3 led to developed economies opening up to immigration from developing economies which led to wages being driven down
5. **Debt** – Increase in debt (through monetary policy) led to businesses running on the loss-making model as well as increased competition
6. **Technology** – the ultimate disinflationary driver which made the World smaller, expedited exchange and execution of ideas, gaslighted innovation, and increased efficiency exponentially

**Now let us understand which of the above disinflationary drivers can slow down or turn inflationary** –

1. **China** – demography is getting older and wealthier and labor-intensive industries such as apparel and footwear are moving to Vietnam and Bangladesh. Also, it could be possible that new disinflationary drivers such as Vietnam, Bangladesh, and India can fill in the capacity of China.
2. **Outsourcing** – many developed countries have elected or are electing populist governments that promise to bring back the jobs by reshoring their industries. Also, Covid lockdowns and the Russian – Ukraine conflict has shown governments how globalized supply chains are vulnerable and de-risking supply chains to some extent by localizing them would be a strategic necessity.
3. **Immigration** – again, many developed countries have elected or are electing governments that promise or have a mandate in place that caps immigration which would cut off access to foreign cheap labor and talent.
4. **Debt** – many developed countries are running debt to GDP ratios in excess of 100% and any increase in debt through monetary policy would be a very unpopular opinion among the population

**And the new drivers of the Inflationary Regime?**

1. **ESG** – The transition to Net Zero involves a large negative supply shock and mega capex
2. **Inequality** – the disinflationary regime of the last 40 years worked in favor of the capitalists against the labor, and the monetary policies in place since 2008 exacerbated this inequality. The current inflationary period will put pressure on governments to work on closing the gap in inequality, which will further increase pressures on inflation
3. **Fiscal Policy** – governments are already putting money in the hands of the people so that they can weather the inflation or are providing subsidies. Fiscal policy is proven to be inflationary.

&amp;#x200B;

**As this is an abridged version, I have briefly listed the reasons for my base case of an inflationary regime. I believe that we are currently in a stagflation environment and may either remain in a stagflation environment for a while or alternate between an inflationary boom and stagflation.**

**Having said that, I would like to briefly mention a few of my thoughts or rather, my musings. Will post these musings in a Part 2 Post as this post is already long.**

**Will update this post with the link to Part 2 when I post it.**",0.7,4,0,4,dd,2022-11-04T19:58:07Z,ym5osp,t3

That's when I realized that I should know the rules of the financial market, to play the money game.

I realized that there are a lot of unfair things, such as: The bank would lend me 125x an amount to invest in a stock, but they wouldn't lend me the same amount to finance a house.

* Apple's market value is now higher than that of Alphabet, Amazon and Meta combined.
* The iPhone maker's worth stands at $2.307 trillion, while its tech peers add up to $2.306 trillion.
* Tech stocks have suffered after posting poor quarterly earnings, but Apple dodged a wipeout.

Apple is now worth more than fellow tech giants Alphabet, Amazon and Meta combined, after it ended trading Wednesday with a market value of $2.307 trillion.

At the same time, the market caps of its three tech giant peers added up to $2.306 trillion at the close of trading Wednesday. Google parent Alphabet's market cap stood at $1.126 trillion, Amazon's at $939.78 billion and Facebook parent Meta's at $240.07 billion, Yahoo Finance data showed.

Overall, Big Tech stocks suffered a brutal selloff last week on the back of disappointing quarterly earnings. But Apple's stock has outperformed its peers after it beat Wall Street's revenue and profit forecasts for its fourth quarter.

The iPhone maker's shares soared 8% in the wake of its results. After their earnings reports, Meta plunged more than 20%, Amazon fell about 10%, while Alphabet saw a single-digit decline.

Alphabet, Amazon and Meta's lackluster earnings signaled that demand for digital advertising is flagging. The poorly-received results have helped wipe billions off their market values as their shares fell, and pushed Amazon out of the trillion-dollar market cap club.

Over the past five sessions, Apple's stock has risen 0.16%, while Alphabet has fallen 5.7%, Amazon is down 17.0% and Meta has lost 7.6% over that period.

Despite Apple's achievement, its market cap has fallen back from its $2.193 trillion value at the end of 2021. A series of headwinds — high inflation, rising interest rates, fears of recession and the Ukraine war among them — have meant tech stocks have struggled in 2022 as investors lost appetite for higher risk assets.

Florida-headquartered hedge fund Elliott Management believes the global economy is in an “extremely challenging” situation which could lead to hyperinflation.

In a report on Thursday (Nov 3), the Financial Times (FT) cited a letter sent to investors (and seen by the newspaper) that “investors should not assume they have ‘seen everything’” because they have been through the peaks and troughs of the 1987 crash, the dot-com boom and the 2008 global financial crisis and previous bear and bull markets.

The British daily newspaper said the firm, led by billionaire Paul Singer and Jonathan Pollock, added that the “extraordinary” period of cheap money is coming to an end and has “made possible a set of outcomes that would be at or beyond the boundaries of the entire post-WWII period”.

The letter said the world is “on the path to hyperinflation”, which could lead to “global societal collapse and civil or international strife”.

Elliott executives estimated that markets have not fallen enough yet and equity markets could drop more than 50% would be “normal”, adding that they couldn’t predict when that would happen.

They warned clients that the idea that “‘we will not panic because we have seen this before’ does not comport with the current facts”.

They blamed central bank policymakers for the current global economic situation, saying they had been “dishonest” about the reason for high inflation.

They said lawmakers had shirked responsibility by blaming it on supply chain disruption caused by the pandemic instead of loose monetary policy imposed two years ago during the Covid-19 peak.

Cross-referencing -- Analysts have mostly rated it a Strong Buy, Buy, and Hold; [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SLCA/) predicts a bullish performance both short and long term. BUT a neutral pattern is detected (see doji-ish star with a slight push up, and commodity channel index). With the recent Fed rate hike and uncertainty in SPX and general indices, here's my even safer bet: a defined risk options trade.

We continue to articulate a different and more stringent test for the economic conditions that would need to be met before raising the federal funds rate.”

In this regard, Powell only slightly adjusted the Fed’s view on inflation from “transitory” to “expected to be transitory.” 

This clearly implies that the central bank is in no hurry to hike the benchmark interest rate from the current range of 0-0.25%…

Overreaction and positioning. Although powell was hawkish because todays fed has a third tool ontop of rates and balance sheet. These dumb press conferences and immediate algo overreactions

He confirmed that now the max before a pause is 4.75. A lot of people were thinking it’ll be closer to around 5. Now the bell curve peaks at 4.5. And tail ends (low probability ends regards) are 4 and 5

Sentiment Algos saw hawkish news and sold. Paper hands sold. You regards doubled down on puts to try to awake from your recent hibernation and porn loss and it dipped fast. Algos saw velocity and acceleration go down fast and it was a snowball. 

Well sorry. Big boys had buy orders at the big supports. They held. Now all analysts have repriced their P/E ratios for this year and next Factoring in the pause when we get to 4.5. And bam. Buy buy buy. Now you’ll have a lot of TINA. Short covering. And any big favorable news will lead to 2-3% up days

These divisions will be: Cannabis, Branding and a 3rd to be named later (this division is being created from within). Our plan provides for each of these divisions to be generating revenue by the end of December 2023.

We estimate that we will file the Super 8-K and financial statements within days after receiving the audit for Consolidated Apparel, Inc (""Consolidated""), which is currently producing about $1.2 million in annual revenues and will remove the Company's Shell designation and add revenue to our books. Consolidated has identified several acquisition targets that complement the Consolidated operations, which if assimilated will potentially increase annual revenues. These transactions, if completed will be structured as Asset Purchases to expedite closings.

In July of 2022, the Company issued 598,800 shares of Series B Preferred for 49.9% of GCTR Management, LLC (""GCTR""), a management company in the cannabis sector in California with two clients. GCTR currently grosses revenues of approximately $300,000 per month. We have an option to purchase the remaining 50.1% percent but will look to extend that date until the end of 2023, so we can pursue other opportunities to increase our presence in the cannabis sector in California. We will continually seek new acquisitions to potentially increase our revenues and will look to lock down 49.9% of two other entities with options to acquire the remaining portion by the end of 2023.

We have agreed to work on new projects with our partners in California with each side owning 50%.

Our new division is being set up from within services of a sector our management has decades of experience in, which we are planning to roll out during the 4th quarter of 2022.

Additionally, in the 4th quarter, we plan to begin setting up operations in the Caribbean to expand both our Branding and Cannabis divisions. For our Branding division, we plan to manufacture products on the island to be sold on the island and export products back to the United States. For Cannabis, we plan to acquire the real estate and equipment needed to operate a manufacturing operation. We will not be involved in the day-to-day operations, but plan to receive a monthly fee for the building and use of the equipment equal to 25% of the monthly revenue.

The Company, in compliance with SEC regulations, will use social media outlets like Facebook or Twitter and its own website at [www.igpk.org](http://www.igpk.org/) to announce key information in compliance with Regulation FD.

A new report delivered to Maryland lawmakers this week shows the national market for legal cannabis growing to $72 billion per year by 2030.

A $75 Billion Industry

The report, which was prepared and presented to the work group by Mathew Swinburne, associate director of Network for Public Health Law-Eastern Region of Baltimore, includes information from New Frontier Data that projects steady growth of the nationwide market as current markets mature and new states are added to the roster of legal cannabis states. Growing from $32 billion in 2022, the projection estimates a total market nationwide of $72 billion by 2030. 

“We know that the cannabis industry is a profitable industry,” said Swinburne. “This is a new industry that is filled with economic opportunity and that opportunity is only growing,” he added. “Although this industry presents some significant economic opportunities, communities of color are missing out on this cannabis boom.”

Swinburne told the work group that jobs in the cannabis industry rose from about 321,000 in 2020 to approximately 428,000 a year later. However, the report also notes that 81% of cannabis businesses are owned by white people and 58% of businesses have no employees who are members of minority groups. 

Main benefactors of this growth remain TRULIEVE, VERANO, GREENTHUMB, CURALEAF, CRESCO Labs 

The five largest MSOS - and most profitable - currently operating in USA.

Hip-hop mogul and entrepreneur is acquiring marijuana assets to be divested in merger of Cresco Labs and Columbia Care

Sean “Diddy” Combs has agreed to purchase licensed marijuana operations in three states for up to $185 million, adding a new business to a portfolio that includes fashion, media and spirits.

If approved by U.S. and state regulators, the deal could create the nation’s largest Black-owned and licensed cannabis company. Mr. Combs said he wants to use the business as a platform to increase Black participation in the cannabis industry.

He said he decided to enter the market to help address long-running inequities. Black people have been disproportionately arrested for marijuana crimes, research has shown. They also comprise a tiny percentage of those making money from the legal cannabis market. In the 26 years since California first legalized medical marijuana, cannabis has grown into a $27 billion legal business in the U.S. and is projected to reach $42 billion in annual U.S. sales by 2026, according to data service BDSA.

The recipients of the proceeds - cresco labs and columbia care who are merging - are one of the top five components of MSOS ETF - which includes TRULIEVE, VERANO, CURALEAF, and GREENTHUMB

There were no good reasons to double down. It was max pessimism. Luckily, I bought more shares on margin. While most of you gave up, I did not falter. BABA has become the equivalent of I-bonds. It is guaranteed to revert back to $200 minimum.

CEO Harry Vafias Commented

This quarter’s unprecedented profitability growth is solid proof that our company’s strategy is paying off. With the capital recently raised we have managed to grow our fleet, substantially increase our profitability and cash flow and create value for our investors. As a result of having acquired six vessels in the course of ten months, we generated net income of $15.5 million in a single quarter which is 15,400% higher than our profit in Q2 22’ and equivalent to 23% of our current market capitalization; We incurred moderate debt during the quarter, maintaining a healthy capital structure with $42.3 million of debt while preserving a free cash balance available for further fleet expansion of about $92 million. Given the strong market fundamentals and the promising charter rate environment and by taking advantage of our efficient management of our expanded fleet, we believe that we will achieve strong results and generate significant cash flow going forward. However, the valuation of our shares of common stock does not reflect our strong financial performance and capital available to fund our growth prospects.",0.6,3,0,3,news,2022-11-04T07:48:46Z,ylq6u3,t3

This carried into the present, where I do the same, but have more money to waste.

Over the past 2 years I've gambled away around 15k into options, which doesn't sound like much, but keep in mind I'm a 19yr old college kid. My gambling addiction from options also led me to get into actual gambling, playing online blackjack and roulette (and of course I lose everything I put into it).

I spend money on almost nothing else but options/gambling. I've put around 20k into other business ventures like game development or e-commerce but I've lost all of that as well because of course those ventures led no-where.

So I am here now, completely broke with a crippling gambling addiction, losing my mind every single night more and more. The only escape I have from this life is the gym, going there almost every day to distract myself from the pure failure I am.

59,wallstreetbets,c0diiii,self.wallstreetbets,8,The Hindenburg Omen - A Indicator Present When Market Conditions Are Ripe For A Crash,"\*\*\*For those of you interested in technical analysis, this post is for you. Before you read the long post, there is a link with a video that is more up to date on market conditions and shows the indicators in action. I thought this was a good topic for a discussion due to current market conditions.\*\*\*

**The Hindenburg Omen** \- A rare market signal with a foreboding name is telling traders to prepare for a possible significant decline. Invoking the memory of the flaming explosion of LZ 129 Hindenburg in 1937. The stock market “Hindenburg Omen” signal plays on images of a monumental disaster.

It is easy to see why many of such observations preceded the **35%** drop in the **S&amp;P 500** in early 2020 – certainly a stock market disaster by any measure. However, when these signals are present, it may be good practice to form an exit strategy and help mitigate any potential losses. Let’s dig into what this indicator is and why its signals are important warnings for precarious market circumstances. 

What is the Hindenburg Omen?

The Hindenburg Omen is a term used in stock trading where certain market conditions align to form a signal. For instance, it’s a warning that conditions are ripe for a steep market decline. 

What are the market conditions to incite this tumble? Look for the following four conditions all occurring on the same day:

* The number of new **NYSE** 52-week highs is greater than **2.8%** of all unchanged issues.
* The number of new **NYSE** 52-week lows is greater than **2.8%** of all unchanged issues.
* The number of new 52-week highs is not more than double the number of new 52-week lows.
* The **NYSE** Composite Index 50-day moving average is rising.

**These first two conditions are the important ones.**

Having a significant number of stocks making new 52-week highs at the same time. While a significant number are making new 52-week lows, signals an unhealthy market. When markets are well-behaved, most stocks tend to move together. When they do not, we should be warned and either readjust or improve our trading discipline. 

\*\*\***That warning puts us on notice that for the subsequent 30 days after any observation, there is a greater than normal chance of a crash on any one of those days where the McClellan oscillator is less than zero.\*\*\***

A Hindenburg Omen in 2022

Market observers saw some signals of another Hindenburg Omen as the markets started to decline in January of 2022. Whether this induces another crash remains to be seen. But it highlights why it is important to keep an eye out for indicators suggesting a crash. Especially in unpredictable markets. They are infrequent, but when they occur, it can give us an early warning to watch for signs that might corroborate a decline.

In late 2021 and again in early 2022, we saw a cluster of Hindenburg Omen observations, as recently as January 14th. That has put us on warning to look for exactly the kind of selling which we have already observed and the potential for even more. On any day when the McClellan oscillator is below zero, down moves could turn ugly.  

This warning sign will remain for a 30-day period from the last observation. When significant selling follows the omen and then turns the 50-day moving average of the **NYSE** composite index down, as it has in early 2022. There cannot be another, fresh Hindenburg observation until the moving average turns back up. Bear markets often begin with attempts to regain a new high which fail. Often this action can set up fresh Hindenburg Omen signals for a subsequent leg down. If markets do bounce, it will be something to watch for.

There are some who say that the Hindenburg, filled with hydrogen, was destined for disaster.  However, the airship traveled ten times from Germany to the United States without incident before the crossing where it burst into flames, and **36%** of those aboard perished.

**Likewise, not every observation of the Omen ends in a stock market disaster. It is, however, a sign of a dangerous condition.**

I found a supporting video that discusses this signal in detail with examples of charts and how you can set it up on our trading platform.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%. (Stats as of 2022-10-28)",0.82,7,0,7,dd,2022-11-04T02:32:00Z,yljvwz,t3

70,wallstreetbets,Able_Excuse_4456,self.wallstreetbets,14,Learn from my mistakes! (Selling Puts),"Not looking for advice here, just sharing some lessons that others may benefit.

I've been using equity Options for a couple years to boost yield. Not Robinhood, not even based on WSB, but legitimate income boosting from my own individual research. It started with simple covered Calls, and then I made a few quick bucks with cash-covered Puts. It was some of the easiest money I ever made.

Jim Cramer says that pigs get slaughtered. Unfortunately, I started getting piggish. Jim does have his moments from time to time.

I got a little looser with my Puts, by not having cash to cover in my brokerage account. I have the cash, but it's in Savings. I started making riskier Puts because they had nice premiums. Had to roll a few, even took a few debits, but was overall positive in taking free cash in exchange for a little risk.

My usual tactic was to watch for a symbol to lose 10-20% in a day, wait a day to stabilize, and then sell a Put for another 20% discount. And I'd get 5% annualized yield. They almost always expire harmlessly OTM. Money for nothing. Easy, right?

Some dipped too close for comfort, or even went ITM. No problem, I can roll. Once or twice, I had to open a new nearly-naked Put position to buy out or roll another one. Like paying off a credit card with another credit card. Financial coaches always recommend that kind of behavior, right?

Well, this week, I had 3 of these riskier semi-naked Put positions hit a trifecta. Bad press, bad earnings call, and the Fed Meeting. All 3 plunged 50-80% in days. Far below the Strike. Of the 3, there is really only 1 that I wouldn't mind owning.

Rolling will cost me almost all my gains from the last year, most of which are already invested into other shares that are covering a Call position. So I'll probably have to infuse more cash to buy back or roll at least 2 just to prevent a forced assignment 50% above the share price. Income accounts are meant to withdraw from, not dump more into just to avoid losing even more cash.

Please learn these lessons:

1. Don't sell a Put on a company that you don't want to own.
2. Have the cash in your brokerage to cover it.
3. Don't transact right before Earnings season when it's already a volatile stock.
4. Low volume Options are harder to roll your way out of.
5. Limit your Puts to 1-2 at any given time.
6. Don't be greedy.

Fortunately for me, these are all low dollar mistakes. I set a personal cap at $25 share price to sell a Put, and that saved my hide. Had this happened with high flyers like Meta, I'd be hosed.

Hear me out. FuboTV is reporting earnings tomorrow morning. There's been an uptick on Google searches for Fubo in the past 3 months alongside increased searches in related topics of sports TV subscriptions:

* [https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=%2Fg%2F11c60pfzx6&amp;geo=US](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=%2Fg%2F11c60pfzx6&amp;geo=US)

Compare this to Roku, which did not experience this search uptick. Roku also spent a lot of capital on physical Roku TVs, which the markets punished after its earnings yesterday. Fubo is unburdened by these types of capital expenditures.

* [https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=%2Fm%2F0\_x7l9\_](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=%2Fm%2F0_x7l9_)

Currently, **short interest in FUBO is 24.95%**. With Fubo trading at all time lows, Fubo just has to not report terrible earnings and awful future projections (subscriptions by sports fans are quite resilient to recessions because it's an ""affordable luxury"") for the stock to rally. This domino can lead to a squeeze.

First of Degens I don't like FB which has 2 billion users still a day I also don't care much for mark Z which is either James Halliday  from Ready player one or IOI, I feel its the latter.

https://preview.redd.it/81o9ob4e9tx91.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ec399ad44901de81c8023e2ea495580e954fe9d

\*I don't care for their policies but I do still keep FB because of family and friends, easiest way to find someone, I also Use IG a lot more lately, and whatsapp.

\* I don't care for Z's meta dream currently but I like the cash generating machine and I like todays 2015 valuation. Here is my thesis for long $META.

META dropped -38% in the last 8 days! Which is a +60% upside to OCT 27th prices. I have a feeling funds will be averaging down soon. See charts below.

https://preview.redd.it/wrzy8aklftx91.png?width=1396&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39bfeff5b048823067907033f7fc049ca2535e23

&amp;#x200B;

[META is projected to grow  to record rev in 2023 to 2025 still and just needs to cut spending. ](https://preview.redd.it/yf06wq8patx91.png?width=2110&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01a967cbf7c19800ac2970d23463433cae9e6796)

First of lets talk about why META is down. Obviously when other tech stocks, some of the biggest in the world can drop -20% overnight like AMZN recently did, NFLX -39% overnight it shows we are in one of the most volatile markets ever. Never have we seen such giant market caps drop this much. So this for 1 presents a big opportunity for me.

:Note NFLX has recovered from that -39% overnight drop and is still up 65% since even with the big drop this past week. It recovered 88% in around 4 months time even with the NASDAQ falling -30% since its drop.

https://preview.redd.it/871e3q18ctx91.png?width=1371&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e12efa6bbc5b3e13656784111d463108b1784ec

&amp;#x200B;

The main reason META is down is because of their spending, but many think Meta is spending only on the METAVERSE which is not the case. Their big spending is for the following which will generate record future cash flow with their current ad rev strategy on new platforms.

**Reasons for future Rev growth even in a recession.**

1)Instagram reels fully monetized

2)Whatsapp &amp; Messenger monetization

3) New AI Discovery Engine to make ad targeting more effective with higher average revenue per user.

4) 2.93+ Billion family users fully monetized.

5)An economic downturn recovery &amp; or more spending for ads again.

**Revenue declined slightly because of the following &amp; can rebound quick**

IMO it is Cyclical as number of users are increasing and user time is rising.

1. U.S. Dollar was beating other currencies and Meta gets a lot of ad rev in international markets.
2. A lot of ads from finance have slowed, the highest paying ads, once we sees a rise in market sentiment those ads come back.

3)Instagram and facebook  reels are not being monetized YET which gets 140 BILLION reels played DAILY!, neither is Messenger and Whatsapp.

4)Apples 2021 Privacy changes, Note The New AI discovery engine will fix this for Meta.

5) Mark and management have started record spending currently on infrastructure /AI discovery engine which is what they are spending the most.

6) 2022 expenses $85-87 2023 projected $96 to $101 billion, which Meta can still be cash flow positive but Mark should and could revamp some spending and do this over 2 years vs 1 and the stock could see a massive move up as funds come back.

7) Many funds have far higher averages and IMO could start averaging up.

These funds below have added before the big drop! Algos have likely been selling as well.

https://preview.redd.it/bt0m3axigtx91.png?width=2132&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a82cce52a2e077bf7e6c704278a2e4b463ebda4d

[META is still top 100 revenue generating companies in the entire world ranked at 65 for rev, and 19 out of 7126 for Earnings STILL.](https://preview.redd.it/qbtgcdfdhtx91.png?width=1293&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=863a7752f43c17aea1b9b7d5a40ba6122dc50e3e)

https://preview.redd.it/m8eyumlcjtx91.png?width=1374&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=580994eecdec4c399d2b3772e1f777f973544164

If the meteverse works out this company is projected to 10x to 25x from todays valuations. 236 Billion and could bring in more revenue than the major stocks with massive overheads AMZN WMT etc with META having little overhead.

 Meta has a family of 3 billion users and growing. Starlink from Elon is  helping third world countries get internet and those are new people to  social media. I have a friend a brazilian actress that visited an amazon  tribe and they are using FB and Instagram and especially whatsapp now  on smart phones. Seriously! Billions of more users open up to social  media as Starlink progresses. People only think in their own bubble and  forget there are billions of people that love metas products. 

TLDR: If meta comes out with a revised spending plan the stock could gap up overnight, They could stretch spending over 2 years vs 1. Even if Metaverse does not work out it can easily 3x from here as spending is for AI ad growth with new infrastructure. Funds Should start to average down soon.

Hope you enjoyed this DD. I like buying Undervalued stocks I got in GME at $4.50 and posted here about it. Not saying Meta is going to go up but I am using profits this year to YOLO it.

# Hedge fund Elliott warns of more pain to come after 2022 market rout

Prominent asset manager says ‘hyperinflation’ could spark one of the worst crises since the second world war

The world is on the road to “hyperinflation” and could be heading towards its worst financial crisis since the second world war, according to Elliott Management, one of the world’s biggest and most influential hedge funds.

The Florida-based firm, which was founded by billionaire Paul Singer and manages about $56bn in assets, has warned its clients of an “extremely challenging” situation for the global economy and for financial markets where investors will find it difficult to make money.

An “extraordinary” set of financial extremes that come as the era of cheap money draws to a close “have made possible a set of outcomes that would be at or beyond the boundaries of the entire post-WWII period,” it wrote in the letter, which was seen by the Financial Times.

“Investors should not assume they have ‘seen everything’” just because they have experienced financial crises such as the 1970s bear market and oil price shock, the 1987 market crash, the dotcom bust or the 2008 financial crisis, it added.

Elliott declined to comment.

The group’s warning comes during a dismal year for markets, in which global equities have shed $28tn in value, according to Bloomberg data, and bonds have also tumbled, leaving investors with few places to seek shelter.

The fund manager laid much of the blame for the looming crisis on central bank policymakers, which it said had been “dishonest” about the causes of high inflation by blaming it on supply chain bottlenecks in the wake of the pandemic, rather than on ultra-loose monetary policy put in place at the height of the coronavirus crisis in 2020.

The world is “on the path to hyperinflation”, it said, which could lead to “global societal collapse and civil or international strife”. While such an outcome is not certain, this is currently the direction that the world was headed, it added.

Its warnings come as investors try to assess the economic damage likely to be felt from a rapid series of large interest rate increases in the US and elsewhere, as central bankers race to try to curb soaring inflation.

The S&amp;P has dropped 20 per cent since its peak at the start of this year, while the Nasdaq is down by one-third since its high a year ago.

However, Elliott said markets had not fallen far enough, given the many risks present, and warned of a further reversal of the so-called ‘everything rally’ seen near the top of the bull market of recent years, as sky-high investor exuberance lifted all manner of risky assets.

There are so many “frightening and seriously negative possibilities” that it is hard not to think that “a seriously adverse unwind of the everything bubble” is coming, it said.

The hedge fund estimates a 50 per cent fall from peak to trough would be “normal”, suggesting further large falls to come in major equity markets, although it added it was impossible to know whether or when that would happen.

Elliott, which is up 6.4 per cent in 2022 and which has only lost money in two calendar years since launch in 1977, pointed to a handful of areas of potential stress that could accelerate market falls. It highlighted banks’ losses on bridge financing, potential markdowns of collateralised loan obligations and leveraged private equity as areas of potential risk for markets.

The firm was also critical of investors who believed market falls will always prove shortlived and can be “ignored”.

The idea that “‘we will not panic because we have seen this before’ does not comport with the current facts”, it said.",0.75,53,0,53,chart,2022-11-04T00:53:12Z,ylhggj,t3

8,wallstreetbets,Kelanfarx,self.wallstreetbets,212,ASTS - An Investment and A Trade (I),"# 1/ ASTS - An Investment and A Trade

If you are a non-virgin, you understand that the sole purpose for investing and trading is to generate returns, to increase the NAV of your brokerage account and to push your net worth in the upward direction. Why? Because it feels good to have the monetary freedom to do whatever the fuck you want, because green GAIN porn is better than red loss porn, and because it is better to look at your account balance and smile instead of twitch in misery. You are here to make money. You are not here to “be right,” — you are here to generate returns, and preferably, returns in excess of the market, in so much excess of the SPY that you are catapulted towards massive capital appreciation (meaningful tendies) before age 80.

The challenge obviously is that it’s extremely fucking difficult to extract money from the markets, especially with an appropriate level of risk. Unless you are a boomer investing with a 50 year horizon, the markets are designed to fuck you over. Markets are difficult and good opportunities are scarce, especially in a bear market environment like we’ve seen YTD. But remember Warren Buffet said “be something when others are something”? Yes, and today is your opportunity.

Right now, an asymmetrical risk-reward investment window is present in ASTS, a company called AST SpaceMobile, where (i) the disruptive technology and scalable commercialization plan are set to create immense value in the coming months, years and decades, (ii) the macro environment allows for a chance to get in *early* into a potential “millionaire maker” name like NVDA or TSLA, and (iii) a contrarian and concentrated bet can provide incredible upside with manageable level of risk.

I am going to spare you impatient people who are already desperately looking for a TLDR from the “generational opportunity” technical thesis but instead show you the swing TRADE SETUP in ASTS that in my mind has a chance of printing money in the next few weeks and months. Three factors: (1) three meaningful catalysts in mid November, (2) continued business plan execution updates, (3) forces from market participants, potentially with better macro tailwinds, could make the ASTS stock spike, consolidate and push upward in a staircase pattern to high levels. Read on.

# 2/ The Background and the Backers

Notwithstanding the fact that Cathie Wood is washed up, disruptive technology wins in the long-term. Not Roku or Zoom but TRUE innovation that propels humankind forward. ASTS pushes forward that kind of technology, aiming to become the first comprehensive space-based cellular service provider, bridging the connectivity gap across the globe by providing high speed internet access to billions of unconnected people, and powering billions of others who move in and out of coverage even in developed markets like the US.

ASTS is launching a network of satellites to provide these services to any mobile device on the planet. That is achieved through deploying and operating satellite “cell towers” in orbit that will cover the entire Earth with 4G / 5G / LTE signal. The technology links directly to any unmodified smartphone, and unlike Starlink, doesn’t require any additional hardware. This monumental step forward in global connectivity is done through launching proprietary 168 BlueBird satellites into orbit and beaming signal through ASTS patented technology.

All sounds dreamy but this achievement means little for ASTS stock without a solid plan for commercialization. ASTS monetizes the technology through B2B revenue sharing agreements with existing global MNOs like AT&amp;T or Vodafone, who already back the company and even have repeated investments in ASTS. These profit sharing mechanisms effectively remove any customer acquisition or CRM costs for ASTS, and open the opportunity for fat free cash flow margins (Transhumanica thinks 90%+ EBITDA margins) after the network is operational.

Right now, ASTS is on path for business plan execution with one of the main hurdles, having the first BlueWalker 3 satellite in space, already complete in September. The BlueWalker 3 is now orbiting Earth at 17,000 mph and is ready to start “unfurling” on November 10th with testing shortly thereafter.

The TEAM: Abel Avellan, Rakuten, Invesat, Vodafone, AMERICAN TOWER corporation.

The guy in charge, the CEO is Abel Avellan. A chad who was founder of another satellite-based communications company EMC that he sold for $550M in July 2016, using proceeds for initial funding of ASTS. He is executing on the business plan with skin in the game with 78M shares (\~$500M currently) and majority of his networth tied in ASTS shares.

Other direct backers that have stakes include **Rakuten, Invesat, Vodafone and American Tower Corporation**. On top of that ASTS has partnerships and conversations with multiple MNOs in different jurisdictions to provide their service through the B2B revenue sharing model once satellites are operational. Quick cap table. Total shares outstanding 183.0M from 10Q as of August 5, 2022.

* BRiley equity research has outstanding $15 PT.
* DB equity research has outstanding $30 PT.
* Barclays equity research has outstanding $15 PT.
* Also people on the ASTS subreddit have provided incredibly detailed research on the technology and the company.

The NON-BELIEVERS:

* Kerrisdale Capital released some bearish seller research if you’re interested in reading a negative scenario case.

# 3/ The Astrology and the Price

As a former SPAC, ASTS first got attention in late 2020 and participated in the high-growth mania of that period, reaching a peak price of over $25 in February 2021. To me, that price action is of little significance as it was fueled by an incredible frenzy in overall markets, which soon deflated and normalized later in the year. The company de-SPACed in April 2021. Since then, ASTS displayed remarkable resilience despite being a high-growth, unprofitable company in a very punishing macro environment, where rising interest rates have caused the valuation DCF discount rates to go up, valuation multiples to go down, acutely hurting stocks that have more expected FCF value in the future.

The market is a mystery and it can price something far from true value for a long time. It’s hard to value ASTS as most cash flow is in the future. To me, if execution is good, I’d just do $5B EBITDA in 2026 and 8x multiple, discounted to today at 20% – we’d see $100+ per share valuation. Of course it’s a bit binary so we have to be aware of the downside risks with execution at zero. Nevertheless the equity research people are bullish including Deutsche Bank, Barclays, BRiley. You can also take a look at numbers at Transhumanica or peruse through spacanpanman’s Twitter with more research and projections summarized neatly.

Deutsche Bank note from August when ASTS spiked on BlueWalker news:

[Deutsche Bank comment](https://preview.redd.it/ntirufb0osx91.png?width=992&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2800afe12df4affb7e6f9bd89f88f695ab84b4e5)

Interestingly, from June 1, 2022 to present the daily return correlation between ASTS and SPY/QQQ has been remarkably low at around 0.38, which I view as a good thing. Less dependent on daily volatility BS from indexes.

ASTS has traded in a huge channel from the lows of $5.50 to the highs of $14.00 since March 2021 to present. Previous multi-year stock “winners” they all came out of incredibly long consolidation bases which we observe here.

[ TradingView chart of ASTS, 1W ](https://preview.redd.it/dliwwerfqsx91.png?width=1813&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f0034d94a9bd64156001576681377529e74819c)

ASTS year-to-date performance as of October 26 is around -22.8%, compared to the QQQ -34.3%. For a high growth stock, it shows incredible strength — compare it with names like ARKK that are down -62.0% YTD, big dog ABNB -45.2% and SNOW -53.8%. This relative strength gives an indication that despite being currently unprofitable ASTS is likely going to be a leader going forward. Strong stocks are often future winners.

Pretty much from early July to mid-August the indexes grinded higher with QQQ up around 20% — during that time ASTS consolidated in a narrow range. After a few catalysts and good reports in early August, ASTS jumped from around $6.5 to around $14 in a matter of a few weeks. At $14 supply zone, the price action slowed and got slammed down with the overall market and sellers, pushing it down with more inflation worries and higher interest rates woes.

Now we are back at the “support” or demand area, at so-called lows where risk-to-reward becomes super attractive.

# 4/ The Dangers of a Bearish Trade and Previous Catalysts

The no-brainer trade this year was to short unprofitable technology and do nothing but watch how the overall market punishes those stocks. That was the “easy” trade on a company like ASTS that sellers capitalized on. The downward adjustment of multiples due to higher interest rates pushed DCF valuation models lower and ASTS price has been sinking. Naturally, sellers use the opportunity to profit from a structural decline where not much can be done really, the tide goes down and takes every ship down with it. BUT, this can be dangerous when a company is executing on the business plan and has positive developments.

This year we had 2 catalysts that showed what can happen when ASTS keeps executing on the business plan.

1. On March 9, 2022 the news came out that ASTS partnered with SpaceX to deliver their satellites to space. That proved ASTS is meaningfully moving forward with its objectives, and resulted in a ferocious seller covering rally that day, where just “riding with tide” as a seller backfired massively. ASTS stock almost doubled in a day: from lows of $6.20 to highs of $11.40. Later, macro pressures set in again, pushing ASTS lower and the “easy” bear trade came back in, sinking all high risk assets.
2. On July 28, 2022 yet another positive news momentum came in with BW3 satellite launch, that forced a lot of sellers to get out of the way. The frenzied rally more than doubled the stock price in a few weeks. Price went from $6.20 to $14.20, then received expected push back and yielded with broad market weakness.

After Kerrisdale released their bearish report in mid-September price nose dived and we visited the $6 “support area” and bottom of the channel. Interesting to note that previous 2 times, the stock launched from around $6.20.

I think right now there is little idiosyncratic movement to the stock, mostly macro pushing it lower, but that is about to change. Now is an optimal time to get in because we are the bottom of the channel and 3 massive catalysts are upcoming next week, hopefully aided by the tailwinds from macro (not guaranteed) and pressures from sellers relenting as company executes.

# 5/ The New LONG Trade and Upcoming Catalysts

We have an ER update call on Monday, November 14. The three main events will serve as proof of company execution and are likely to push the price up in the next few weeks.

1. Unfurling of the BW3 satellite is going to happen on November 10. Successful completion is likely to serve as a big catalyst to the stock. Satellite will open up and become operational and ready for testing.

[Furled](https://preview.redd.it/5y3wecosqsx91.png?width=643&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd2ae1d0649d74a9db5fe749c1856a6d70bd0d6e)

[Unfurled](https://preview.redd.it/ew43yfytqsx91.png?width=651&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=916c4d08e26af04ecfd10f47c8a29ee23fe2dce1)

2. Testing of the satellite should happen shortly thereafter and an announcement confirmation of working technology is going to be an even larger event for ASTS. This will be the proof that technology works with MNOs.

3. Other funding or partnership updates, like 5G Fund providing indication of possible financing to ASTS may happen by the end of the year, as well as getting licenses in new jurisdictions (Japan), or more partnerships with MNOs.

[Comments on ASTS eligibility for being financed by FCC's 5G Fund](https://preview.redd.it/g1iknnuvqsx91.png?width=1093&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83b7a48437c40c0dc87d4b6a3f9a2ab964afeb4f)

One of the arguments of sellers is that company will need additional funding before generating meaningful free cash flow. Currently they do have runway to revenue, and that gets even better if the FCC 5G fund awards capital to ASTS or if price stays at $18+ for a month, where warrants become redeemable for $200M of capital. Moreover, there’s other non-dilutive financing options, but regardless I think they’ll be explored in second half of 2023 or later.

&amp;#x200B;

[From spacanpanman](https://preview.redd.it/co5m5bc0rsx91.png?width=1194&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a1991c6fc6b4ae4c8fef5e73a7840c35434eeac)

The reason why I think the moves up on positive news could be violent is because there will be additional buying pressure from bearish traders to get cover their positions in face of good data.

Once ASTS confirms that these events are successful, stock will likely become favored by passive and risk-averse investors, with institutional funds buying in and momentum/breakout traders scaling into positions. I believe we’ll get to $14 area if updates are positive, and a breakout above that is likely to clean the path to $18+ which I think is going to be the turning point for the company, that will set it up for long term success.

[ASTS 1D timeframe, imaginary price action.](https://preview.redd.it/wrcwev02ssx91.png?width=1814&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c19d086660cb232eff0c4b823b17f25bc91d5f2d)

Disclaimer, Risks:

Past performance is not indicative of future results. This is not financial advice. There are risks of company failing and stock going to zero.

TLDR:

The no brainer trade this year was to short unprofitable technology and just sit tight. But it is dangerous now, especially on a company like ASTS, which is a powder keg that can explode on successful business developments that are to be announced on November 10 and shortly after. Three upcoming catalysts are likely to serve as a repeat of price action in March and August. Although price is artificially suppressed by the macro environment, once that pressure subsides, the stock will stay high and keep pushing forward as company executes.

The biggest thing that I mentioned bear wise that happened yesterday was that we broke through key 378 support (green channel). I had mentioned that 370.5 was another big area. I highlighted it here to make it a little more clear. You can see that there is a clear resistance/ support line right there. With SPY breaking through and then holding over it all day and closing over it today I am actually looking for an upside resistance test. 

SPY has put in 4 red days in a row now so it could be expected we get a green day. The other oddity to say the least is that SPY closed down -1.02% and the VIX also closed down -2.28%. Usually I would say that doesn’t happen but in 2022 and lately its happening more and more. Despite everything the JPOW said yesterday the fear isn’t rising in the markets. This is either  sign by the VIX that we should continue to be bullish and expect upside or this is a really “cheap” opportunity to buy some longer DTE puts. 

Bulls will want to defend 370.5 tomorrow again and more or less leave it in the dust and completely gap fill 374.76 tomorrow. From there they need to retest the 378 resistance line and attempt to break back into that zone. 

Bears will want to finally take out 370.5 and close below it with hopes of testing 365 to 359.9 tomorrow and into next week. This is the first time we have had a full candle close below the daily 8ema since before CPI. 

Key support- 370.5 -&gt; 365 -&gt; 359.9

Key resistance- 374.6 -&gt; 378

Looking at futures we nicely held resistance at 3770 and were not quite able to break through support at 3705. Bulls will look to retake 3770 and possibly key 3805 tomorrow. 

Bears will look to continue the sell off and seek out 3705 and most importantly 3675 support.

Apple looked incredibly heavy compared to the rest of the market and actually was the worst top 10 ticker of the day just barely beating out Google. Interestingly enough Apple is only $3 away from its after hours low of 136 on earnings day. 

Now that Apple is back at the 138.2 support area this is where we can look for it to bounce if it is going to bounce. However, something to keep in mind is that unlike tesla and other stocks Apple has NOT put in its 2nd 52week low… this very well could be its attempt at doing so. 

We have a nice black downward channel inside of a falling wedge that also have a falling wedge inside of the black channel… lol yes I know right? 

Key support- 138.2 -&gt; 135 -&gt; 130

Key resistance- 142.2 -&gt; 144.8

&amp;#x200B;

Tesla continues to be all over the place. We did see it break through that “mid” point of 215 today however it was able to find support nicely at 210. However, it did break through the 2 day drop resistance line it was not able to break through and take out the daily 8ema this morning and had a pretty strong rejection there. I will be looking to see if Tesla finds support here with this doji on a downrend which can lead to an upside recovery or if it will indeed retest 205.6 support tomorrow. 

Key support- 214.9 -&gt; 210 -&gt; 205.6

Key resistance- 219.3 -&gt; 226.1

The VIX just absolutely continues to unwind here and doesn’t seem to be phased by anything at all anymore. What will cause the VIX to spike and revery back to the 28-30+ range? Honestly im not sure at this point. The really only big bear event ahead is CPI next Thursday but besides that we have nothing till December. December actually is doing to be a Doozy with CPI on a Tuesday immediately followed the next day by FOMC. 

This CPI still does not have a consensus out… which gives me the same type of vibes from last September CPI which could result in a bigger sell off again. I wouldnt be surprised to see a short rally tomorrow till next week. Markets are looking for that “oh wow yeah lets sell” reason again and I don’t forsee one till CPI. CPI most likely will miss and that’s where it gets complicated. On one hand we know jpow said he isn’t ready to slow or pause… he said inflation aint fixed… so another bad CPI maybe he rockets a 100bps at us? Definitely another 75bps at us… how will markets react? Will we react like September or will we react like October.

We also get to add in the unemployment rate to the mix tomorrow if you remember last month when this hit we had an incredibly red open when this news hits the market.

I am still playing to start the 2.5k challenge… I am refining my strategy on the rules and deciding if I wanna do 2.5k per trade or do a 5k account one trade a day for 10%/ 20% stop loss challenge. I am undecided and will think about it this weekend more.

And not just BOE, the FED has also mentioned the war as a leading factor. [(source)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT2H9iyd-ms)

IF true, and a big if.

Putin's course of action is to play the war out as long as possible win or lose irrelevant, as along as it provide an excuse to bomb pipelines (DONE), and participate in predatory market practices (DONE), and break economic agreements (DONE). Russia doesn't need boots on American soil when he can simply have the central banks do the job for him.

This is a well played out market manipulation on the futures markets and he's causing ripples across the globe and to Russia's benefit.

49,wallstreetbets,predictany007,self.wallstreetbets,10,"Netflix ad tier debuts at 'a pivotal moment for the industry,' ad exec explains","Netflix's (NFLX) ad-supported tier officially arrives in the United States on Thursday.

The ad plan, dubbed ""Basic with Ads,"" will cost $6.99 a month in the U.S. — just below Disney's ad-based price point of $7.99 (which will roll out on December 8.)

""Basic with Ads"" will complement Netflix's existing ad-free tiers and be available in 12 countries, including the U.S., the U.K., Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, and Spain.

The ad tier will feature an average of 4-to-5 minutes of ads per hour. At launch, ads will run 15 or 30 seconds in length, with some running prior to the start of a program while others will be mid-roll ads.

Wall Street analysts are largely bullish on the profitability aspects of the new ad tier, and advertising experts refer to the debut as a make-or-break moment for the media industry.

""It is absolutely a pivotal moment for the industry,"" Kevin Krim, CEO of advertising measurement platform EDO, told Yahoo Finance, citing Amazon's (AMZN) Thursday Night Football as another watershed moment when streaming, subscription, and ad-supported went to the masses.

Looking back, the executive explained, this ""will be the moment where the vast majority of Americans became crystal clear that there's going to be a new way to get the must-watch TV that they care about — and it's going to be through a subscription-based and an ad-supported business model.""

Amid concerns that Netflix subscribers will trade down to the ad-supported version, Citi Managing Director Jason Bazinet previously told Yahoo Finance Live that he views the introduction of advertising as a lucrative revenue driver.

""It's not a spin down risk — it's a spin up opportunity,"" the analyst maintained, estimating that the company could secure $10 or more in advertising revenue per ad-tier subscriber in the U.S.

Based on me being 15% down on my position (7000 shares @ $4.02) and the 2 hours (maybe 1.5) of ""research"" I've done, I have concluded that this stock is underpriced.

The stock is reeling from the news that CVS has likely pulled a purchase offer, but it seems like everyone has forgotten that Humana $HUM is still looking to buy, always had right of first refusal, and is primed to purchase (still up 30% on the year). Both CVS and Humana are desperate to get more of that Medicare Advantage plan money and are basically fighting to buy the company. CVS reportedly stated in their conference call that they are still looking to get into primary care through acquisitions, and failed on their attempt to purchase One Medical who was instead bought by Amazon. Meaning the ""news"" of their pullout is likely bullshit to get $CANO back on sale for the institutions before the actual buyout. Not to mention the market cap of CANO is $1 billion less than the enterprise value (whatever that means, it seems good). Analyst's lowest forecast is $4.04, still giving this an %18 upside worst case scenario and a buyout could reasonably drive this to $12 if not higher.

Let me explain my theory on profit vs debt","It’s counter intuitive but many companies don’t want to make profit these days. There are many problems with being profitable. First you have to pay tax on profits. Second making profit is actually difficult. Third if you start to make profit it will never be enough for the market and you can’t sell a story of hyper growth company to pump your stocks.

What companies really wanted is asset appreciation whether it be their stocks or real estate. In world of money printing, cheap debt and fiat system, most asset values always go up in price over time. 

Appreciating assets allows businesses to cash out refinance at lower rates. Unlike profit, this borrowed money is tax free as per IRS. The tax free borrowed money is then used to boost revenues through ads, pump stocks thru buybacks &amp; sustain lifestyle of executives and their sugar babies. 

The ponzi continues because some of the borrowed money is used to pump the asset prices. Declining rates help as well. As the debt servicing costs decline it boosts the asset prices allowing businesses to get new round of cash out refinance, pay down smaller debt with bigger debt and continue the ponzi.

Powell grew up in different world where companies actually relied on profits for their liquidity. Not anymore. Business models rely heavily on cheap debt these days. In fact they prefer tax free cheap debt over taxable profits which requires running an efficient business and not just financial engineering.

Powell doesn’t understand simple fact it was the declining rates of last 40 years and access to tax free cheap debt that provided liquidity to businesses and also allowed them to keep prices low for their consumers and inflation in check.

I averaged down nicely on my initial TWLO position.  
The spreads are wide, so it is taking me a while to get my fills.

Depending on what happens near EOD, I'll either add more calls to DKNG or open a very large short sell position on TWLO to offset IV crush and theta (if the stock goes down that is).

I believe that this increased interest rate risk has already been priced in.

So I with this being said I am currently holding 3 calls that expire April 2023.

* Shares of Airbnb fell more than 13% Wednesday, a day after the company released third-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street’s estimates but fell short on fourth-quarter guidance.
* For the fourth quarter, Airbnb said it expects to deliver between $1.80 billion and $1.88 billion, below the midpoint of $1.85 billion as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.

Shares of Airbnb fell more than 13% Wednesday, a day after the company released third-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street’s estimates but fell short on fourth-quarter guidance.

Airbnb beat on top and bottom lines in its third quarter. The company posted revenue of $2.9 billion, up 29% year-over-year for its strongest quarter ever, and topped analysts’ estimates of $2.8 billion, according to Refinitiv. The revenue increase was driven by stable growth in the Nights and Experiences booked and elevated average daily rates.

But Airbnb provided fourth-quarter revenue guidance of $1.80 billion and $1.88 billion, below the midpoint of $1.85 billion as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.

Airbnb said to “expect a continued, albeit choppy, recovery of cross-border travel to be a further tailwind to future results” as countries around the world continue to recover from Covid lockdowns and grapple with high levels of inflation and rising interest rates.

5,wallstreetbets,predictany007,self.wallstreetbets,4,"Guggenheim downgrades Roku, citing warning signs after latest quarterly report","Analyst Michael Morris downgraded the television streaming stock to neutral from buy and removed his price target on the name. He previously had a target of $70 per share on Roku.

“We believe in the long-term opportunity for CTV and see Roku’s active account base and operating assets as valuable,” he said in a note to clients, referencing the app CTV that allows users to watch TV. “However, we struggle to value the business given the lack of detail from the company and the warning indicators.”

On Wednesday, the company issued fourth-quarter revenue guidance that was well below expectations, along with a larger-than-expected adjusted EBITDA forecast. Roku did reported a smaller-than-expected loss for the third quarter, but Morris noted those expectations were already slashed as the business has suffered.

He called the fourth-quarter guidance the “primary surprise,” noting it was “well below” prior forecasts and implied revenue declines due to a drop in up-front spending from advertisers. But he still expects the company to beat when reporting fourth-quarter earnings.

Fourth-quarter total net revenue guidance was predicted by Guggenheim to be 1% lower than the same quarter a year ago. The firm previously expected it to grow 4% in the quarter. Ad revenue is expected to decline 5% in the quarter after being forecast to grow by 7%, while total platform revenue should grow 0.5% compared to the 6% growth expected before the earnings call.

Morris said there is concern over the magnitude of the soft cyclical environments impact on advertising space not bought at the “upfront” event.

Meanwhile, he said the company is still operating at a loss and is likely to increase spending if conditions improve. He also pointed to what he called a lack of visibility into the company’s business drivers such as advertising revenue trends, investment goals and profitability objectives that make it hard to predict future performance.

The stock plummeted 19% in premarket trading following the earnings release Wednesday. Roku has taken a beating this year, losing more than 76.2% through Wednesday’s close.

On Nov. 1st, Uber reported better-than-expected quarterly results. It reported an adjusted loss of 61 cents a share on revenue of $8.34 billion. Analysts expected Uber to report a loss of 18 cents a share on revenue of $8.1 billion. 

Uber's total gross bookings were $29.12 billion, slightly below expectations of $29.67 billion. But the company expects total fourth-quarter bookings to rise 23% to 27% from a year earlier. Uber also gave its fourth-quarter profit before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) guidance range of $600 million to $630 million. Wall Street was expecting $567 million.

CEO Dara Khosrowshahi gives the impression in a statement Tuesday, saying the company delivered a ""strong quarter” and is “well positioned to deliver expanded profitability in the coming quarters.”

Meanwhile, UBER also sees positive comments from Evercore ISI’s Tech analyst Mark Mahaney and Wedbush’s analyst Dan Ives. According to Mark Mahaney, Uber is part of the $2 trillion global ride-sharing and delivery market. He thinks the company is on track to grow bookings by about 30% from its current 90 million customers.

""Uber is continuing to see healthy growth as the driver shortage is essentially over while the company continues to benefit from travel returning, shifting to the office, as other post-pandemic trends continue to hold globally with Uber poised to benefit into 2023,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to clients.

19,wallstreetbets,Guilty-Ham,self.wallstreetbets,83,‘Dramatic increase.’ Foreclosure filings are up more than 150%. Here’s what that tells us about the housing market,"The number of foreclosure starts — which is when the first public foreclosure notice happens — is up 219% since the start of the year, according to real estate data analytics firm ATTOM Data Solutions’ midyear 2022 U.S. foreclosure market report. What’s more, the number of properties that had foreclosure filings (this number includes foreclosure starts) is up 153% from the same time period last year. 

Fully 96% of major metro areas saw an annual increase in foreclosure filings, with foreclosure rates highest in Illinois, New Jersey and Ohio. And when it comes to the number of foreclosure starts, California topped the list, followed by Florida, Tennessee, Illinois and Ohio.

“Foreclosure activity across the United States continued its slow, steady climb back to pre-pandemic levels in the first half of 2022,” says Rick Sharga, executive vice president of market intelligence at ATTOM. “While overall foreclosure activity is still running significantly below historic averages, the dramatic increase in foreclosure starts suggests that we may be back to normal levels by sometime in early 2023,” says Sharga. (See the lowest mortgage rates you can get here.)
What does this uptick in foreclosures mean for the housing market?

Foreclosures are shooting up as the various foreclosure moratoriums that kept people in their homes during the worst of the pandemic’s economic disruptions have now ended, explains Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com. That said, they are shooting up from extremely low levels, she adds — noting that even after the sharp increase in foreclosure activity observed in the first half of 2022, we’re still not back to 2019’s low pre-pandemic mid-year total.

“Much like the sharp turnaround in housing inventory that we’ve observed in the number of for-sale homes recently, when the market has tilted in one direction very extremely, we see huge percentage increases when the trends shift back in a different direction, even though in many aspects what we’re witnessing is just a return to something resembling what was once normal,” says Hale.

Indeed, “it’s important to note that many of the foreclosure starts we’re seeing today — in fact, much of the overall foreclosure activity we’re seeing right now is on loans that were either already in foreclosure or were more than 120 days delinquent prior to the pandemic,” says Sharga. Indeed, many of these loans were protected by the foreclosure moratorium put in place by the government during the pandemic — therefore just halting the inevitable by a couple of years. Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate says, “Foreclosure activity is returning to normal levels after being artificially depressed by pandemic-induced payment relief programs and extended foreclosure moratoriums. In a historical context, foreclosures are still very low.”

And while these foreclosure numbers sound dramatic, Holden Lewis, home and mortgage expert at NerdWallet, says it’s not enough to make a dent in the housing market or the overall economy. “Even a healthy housing market has foreclosures, and this pace is nothing to worry about,” says Lewis.
What does this mean for buyers?

While foreclosures remain unfortunate for the owners of those homes, for shoppers who have been frustrated by the lack of homes for sale in their budget, the increase in foreclosures could bring additional options, says Hale. “But much like the increases we see in for-sale housing inventory, it’s just the first step. We would need to see many more months of these increases before home shoppers will feel like they have an abundance of homes to choose from,” says Hale. source without paywall: https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marketwatch.com%2Fpicks%2Fdramatic-increase-foreclosure-filings-are-up-more-than-150-heres-what-that-tells-us-about-the-housing-market-01659181360",0.93,102,0,102,news,2022-11-03T10:01:19Z,ykvrzo,t3

* It takes 9-12 months for rate hikes to be felt and 12-18 months for the maximum effect. It makes sense to slow down the current pace given we are only eight months past the first rate hike.
* Fed will want slower total and core inflation, pullbacks in house prices and rents, slower wage growth, lower job openings, and likely an increase in the unemployment rate prior to a real pivot.
* Fed is also concerned about the upcoming winter heating season that may cause another spike in energy prices.
* Rate hikes are likely to continue into 2023 in smaller increments.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn.

The vix futures curve shows a continuation of its decline for the next 1-2 weeks. Even the vix9d had a sharp decline and fall hard along with the broader market.

Does that mean earnings is likely going be bad?  As they could of announced this “somewhat” good news on earnings, but decided to issues the news a day prior to earnings.

The specific company I am talking about is Virgin Galactic SPCE.  Earnings is tomorrow and while they have no earnings the expectation is that their spaceship fleet is ready to fly.  However might get delayed.

Today they provided a update that they have found suppliers for their next generation fleet.

86,wallstreetbets,0x11C3P,self.wallstreetbets,16,Fed Talk + JPOW opinions,"I closed out my puts today for some modest gains. Listening through the meeting and listening it through it again, I do sense a bit dovishness in his speech. More so than I had originally anticipated looking at the underlying economic data. Caveat to that is it really involves one thing, the rate of increase, not overall Fed Fund rate increase. On the latter, it looks like he's taking that 25 bps and going to push it towards the Feb meeting. I'm overall still bearish for the time being. 

The rate hike that I initially anticipated would be 75 bps for December. It's looking highly more likely that'll it'll be 50 bps. That said, it's looking way more likely that Feb will be 50 bps increase as well in 2023 and will hold it there. That'll push it towards the 4.75%-5% range.

That said, if economic data doesn't improve halfway through this month going past December, I'm thinking they'll keep pushing rates into Q2 2023 most likely in 25 bps range pushing it over the 5% Fed fund rate point. 

Plan your strategies accordingly and expect a bumpy ride. This latest messaging was less clear with mixed economic data coming. 

TL;DR: Swing trade until mid December data. Expect new bottoms to form some time over the next couple months and then hit capitulation in Q1 2023. Will most likely go sideways for most of 2023 with solid recovery going into Q4.",0.86,5,0,5,question,2022-11-03T00:07:26Z,ykj8cn,t3

Powell agreed there wil at some point be a time to slow rate… however, he confirmed that time is not now and it would be pre-mature… The question that will remain now is was this some unbelievably wild over reaction to what JPOW said or did we just witness the top get put in? There is a case to be made for both that’s for sure.

I took the 389C overnight and that was looking rough for a really long time this morning. Thankfully with the rogue pump before FOMC and then the 2pm pump that was expected I exited for a pretty decent win. Not the best exit but when its moving like that it’s the best you can do for sure. 

That pump also allowed me as expected to exit my now 5dte 386C too for almost 20% win.

I did follow my plan of the 234pm calls. I entered and hit 30% profits pretty much instantly… unfortunately that was where the music stopped playing for me. I fully expected based on movement that we were going to see a really big bullish break out on SPY after the 230 presser as historically has happened. However, it dumped pretty much immediately after I entered. I never saw green again and there was no sense to average down or try to do anything silly. 

If you were okay with small profits it did hit, however, if you weren’t fast it turned into a loss.

Someone asked me last night “why don’t you present a bearish case too?” well until today there wasn’t really a reason to present one. What do I mean by that? Well we had been holding this red bull channel for over 3 weeks now. There was little reason to bet against that until we saw like now a breakdown of that support. 

With SPY now breaking through that green channel support of 378.1 and not only that it also rejected the attempted break through of 388.6 resistance I do favor a bearish case now. With the blue resistance line and red bull channel support line there was also a rising wedge formed that has now broken. 

From here we look at our key levels which will be that 378.1 resistance level. If SPY can break back through there and close over that level tomorrow there actually could be a case made that today was some massive over reaction and we are going to see a reversion to mean break to the upside 385 range tomorrow. However, if we back test and reject 378.1 that is even more confirmation of downside to come. 

If you remember since last CPI the media was screaming a fed pivot and a fed slowing of rate hikes. Overall JPOW effectively just said that is NOT happening right now but in the future will happen. With that narrative now squashed where are we going to go next? The next thing on the Agenda is CPI on November 10th which so far we still do not have a consensus on core or CPI yet. However, monthly CPI is consensus of 0.7 which would be a 0.3% rise over previous MoM. I expect that CPI to release soon and I expect that could absolutely move the markets. 

Key support- 374.6 -&gt; 370.5 -&gt; 365

Key resistance- 378.1 -&gt; 379.9 -&gt; 384.1 -&gt; 388.6

Futures does not look any better then SPY and has broken through the red bull channel support also and landed at 3760 support. This will be the next support that bears what to try to take out. Bulls will look to get this back over 3865 by EOW if they want to remain bullish going forward. 

One major bearish thing we can take away here is that this week effectively was a daily 100ema rejection and now huge break down through daily 8 and 20ema. The bearish case is rising in strength. 

Key support- 3705 -&gt; 3675 -&gt; 3585

Key resistance- 3800 -&gt; 3865 -&gt; 3925

Apple actually was the last domino to fall today and even more interestingly about Apple it has officially broken through the bottom from Friday. That huge green day that Apple had on Friday is now completely gone and then some. 

With this bull channel now broken we are looking at downside obviously now too. It is hard to tell in this picture because if I zoomed out too far it would be hard to see the candles but we are actually seeing quite a bit of red. Looking at the daily you can see that 150.6 is the KEY pivot level of bullish vs. bearish and we are seeing a pretty aggressive rejection of the daily 100 and 200ema which I mentioned earlier would take a few trading days to play out. 

Key support- 144.7 -&gt; 141.1 -&gt; 138.2 

Key resistance- 149.2 -&gt; 150.6 -&gt; 153.4 -&gt; 155.4

They really did massacre my girl Tesla today. I was actually impressively bullish on tesla with that closure over key 230 and the candle body over the daily 20ema which fully closing over the daily 8ema. However, we just saw a pretty massive rejection of the daily 20ema today and closure just above key support at 214.9. 

Key support- 214.9 -&gt; 210 -&gt; 205.6

Key resistance- 219.4 -&gt; 225.8 -&gt; 229.9

What would a -2.5% red day on SPY be without the VIX closing barely green at 0.12%... Well I had imagined they were unwinding the VIX for FOMC and especially for CPI next week, however, I would have expected to see a reaction on the VIX especially with this dump. There is clearly still fear and unknown in this market thanks to JPOW today, however, the VIX didn’t really react. Will it react tomorrow? Or is this going to end up being a straight volume dump with VIX once again being detached? 

Daily log- 

Well I am going to start doing these a little differently! I am going to start a 2.5k 10% take profit/ 20% stop loss challenge. So EOD you will see me post my daily log and post results of a 2.55k challenge. I will probably end up making a separate post for the 2.5k challenge also. For me usually my first trade of the day is my best trade so I will utilize my first entry for the trade. I will use the full $2500 per trade (well as close as I can) and I will update this via Excel like my normal port. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1g4jz5ebqlx91.png?width=828&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05a2491de9d015a29655f9088fa96de3697abc0f

I will start the challenge tomorrow just going to move a few things around in my accounts. Now the thing with this is that it is NOT about full porting… that’s absolutely not what im doing this for and $5000 is not a full port for me. What I am doing instead is hoping to show you guys whether its $500, $1000, $2500, $10,000, etc. etc. If you have proper strategy and risk management and take small profits those small profits will add up over time. This is to show you compound growth. Yes one loss of 20% does set you back two 10% wins, but if you continue to trade the $2,500 it adds up and recovers fairly quickly. 

This is not a full port as I said… I will be utilizing $2,500 PER TRADE so as you see above the starting “balance” is $2,500 but that’s not all that is in there. In the future I may do another one of just one trade a day starting with like $5,000 or something in the account and attempt to grow that… the same premise remains though that as long as you maintain a good strategy one loss really only takes 2-3 trades to over come. With premiums being so ridiculous right now it’s a little hard to use less then $2,500 and even some days $2,500 will be a stretch but like I said it will be as close to $2,500 as it can be. 

I will continue to trade normally in my other account doing day traders/ scalps and of course my level to levels. 

&amp;#x200B;

Not my best day but not my worse day. The important lesson today was no matter how highly probable a trade is… it can ALWAYS go against you and not only that… it is only a high probability trade if we remember to take profits. These trades that are the “big hitters” have to be lotto size and you have to understand that as you see above there is a chance it goes straight to zero.

8,wallstreetbets,Annual_Equipment_370,self.wallstreetbets,54,I'm pivoting,"Wow, I'm just gonna cash out, delete my brokerage app and forget about fucking stocks forever.  
This week I've accurately used my 3 pre-PDT trades to gain $500 and get rid of this status right before today's shitstorm. I was sitting in cash, 25.2k, just waiting for the FOMC, playing chess and thinking that I'm probably done for today unless market chooses a clear direction after the meeting. Then I see a notification on my phone. YOUR POSITION MAY BE LIQUIDATED.   


wat?  


I opened the app and saw that I'm fucking shorting SQQQ at 52.00 and it's 53.50 now. I forgot to cancel one of the stop orders and went short on margin. I freaked out, tried to cancel the trade via app support and set a buy order at 52.11. Eventually the position was closed at this price and I only lost like $50 on that. And a shitload on neurones.  


After I closed the position, I had a chat with my gf about all the situation, we freaked out, but I felt lucky to escape a potential infinite loss.   


So, happy end, huh? I've evaded PDT status by doing two good trades and dodged this short margin position liquidation.  


Well, after some time I saw a bunch of enormous green dicks on SQQQ chart, realised that market has decided to finally dump and I still can join the trend, bought some SQQQ at 56.00, with default stop loss at 55.00 and profit taker at 57.00. Right after my order was filled, the stonk started to tank. I felt stressed af. It was too much for today and just wanted to exit the trade, fuck off and chill till tomorrow. Instead of closing it with minimal loss, I just watched SQQQ dropped to 55, lost $500, received PDT status, then in half an hour SQQQ jumped to 58, and to 59 in another half an hour. So if I haven't initialised the trade, I would've been +$450 today. If I've sold at a $100 loss, I'd still be fine. If I've managed my stop loss according to volatility, I would've been + extra $1k at close.  


Instead, I'm banned from trading for 90 days. I just watch the market rapidly tanking, feel even more FOMO and self-hatred for being stupid enough to do some emotional trades after such a day and risking my 25k PDT limit. I can't deposit extra money to the account, because my Ukrainian bank doesn't allow me to send USD abroad due to war time restrictions.  


I was waiting for this fucking FOMC and upcoming 52w lows during this whole bullshit rally month, hoping to ride the SQQQ till SPY @ 360. Now I'm fucked, my plan is fucked, finances are fucked. Total loss: $5k. Not as devastating as some of you apes have, but painful enough, and I won't be able to manage this loss in the next 90 days, maybe never, I just feel sick from these fucking candles. Maybe I'll just buy virgin IVW in Feb and maybe will be able to cover my losses in 5 years with the help of cOmPoUnD iNtErEsT. If we won't die in fucking great nuclear war recession till then.

# Final Comment

&amp;#x200B;

AMC is a heavily indebted company; the leverage is unsustainable, and the company is struggling to have positive net income. Its Cash Burning Rate is at 2.56, meaning its spending 2.5 times more its cash availability, giving the company a life expectancy of 30 moths with its current cash &amp; cash equivalents. It will need to cash in accounts receivables to extend more its life expectancy.

Income quality dropped drastically since 2018, it means that total earnings do not correspond to the actual cash intake from its operations.

Cash Ration indicate that the company will struggle to pay its current liabilities with its current cash.

Without  a drastic change in its fundamentals, the company is in high risk.

It is advisable to keep an eye on the Company operations and Management Action and evaluate possible adjustments for the final pricing without any changes in trends, the company is destined to die.

&amp;#x200B;

Long term forecast is more pessimistic than previously forecasted. 


IMO they will get interest rates close to core inflation and see how much it slows down inflation. Then they may increase it further for a full on recession to bring prices down by killing the economy. 


If core inflation does start going down through Q4 and early 2023, we will see slower rate increases. If stays high, we're going to 6% very fast.

70,wallstreetbets,predictany007,self.wallstreetbets,12,Fed approves 0.75-point hike to take rates to highest since 2008 and hints at change in policy ahead,"The Federal Reserve on Wednesday approved a fourth consecutive three-quarter point interest rate increase and signaled a potential change in how it will approach monetary policy to bring down inflation.

In a well-telegraphed move that markets had been expecting for weeks, the central bank raised its short-term borrowing rate by 0.75 percentage point to a target range of 3.75%-4%, the highest level since January 2008.

The move continued the most aggressive pace of monetary policy tightening since the early 1980s, the last time inflation ran this high.

Along with anticipating the rate hike, markets also had been looking for language indicating that this could be the last 0.75-point, or 75 basis point, move. Specifically, some Fed officials along with Wall Street economists and strategists in recent weeks had talked of a “step-down” in policy that could see a rate increase of half a point at the December meeting and then a few smaller hikes in 2023.

That language was not overt in the post-meeting statement from the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, though there was a tweak that could point to an adjustment in policy.

This week’s statement expanded on previous language simply declaring that “ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate.“

The new language read: “The Committee anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time.“

The statement reiterated that policy changes “will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.“

Markets will look to Chairman Jerome Powell’s news conference at 2:30 p.m. for more clarity on whether the Fed thinks it can implement less restrictive policy that would include a less dramatic level of rate hikes to achieve its inflation goals.

Along with the tweak in the statement, the FOMC again categorized growth in spending and production as “modest” and noted that “job gains have been robust in recent months” while inflation is “elevated.” The statement also reiterated language that the committee is “highly attentive to inflation risks.“

The rate increase comes as recent inflation readings show prices remain near 40-year highs. A historically tight jobs market in which there are nearly two openings for every unemployed worker is pushing up wages, a trend the Fed is seeking to head off as it tightens money supply.

Concerns are rising that the Fed, in its efforts to bring down the cost of living, also will pull the economy into recession. Powell has said he still sees a path to a “soft landing” in which there is not a severe contraction, but the U.S. economy this year has shown virtually no growth even as the full impact from the rate hikes has yet to kick in.

At the same time, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure showed the cost of living rose 6.2% in September from a year ago – 5.1% even excluding food and energy costs. GDP declined in both the first and second quarters, meeting a common definition of recession, though it rebounded to 2.6% in the third quarter largely because of an unusual rise in exports. At the same time, housing prices have plunged as 30-year mortgage rates have soared past 7% in recent days.

On Wall Street, markets have been rallying in anticipation that the Fed soon might start to ease back as worries grow over the longer-term impact of higher rates.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained more than 13% over the past month, in part because of an earnings season that wasn’t as bad as feared but also amid growing hopes for a recalibration of Fed policy. Treasury yields also have come off their highest levels since the early days of the financial crisis, though they remain elevated. The benchmark 10-year note most recently was around 4.04%.

There is little if any expectation that the rate hikes will halt anytime soon, so the anticipation is just on a slower pace. Futures traders are pricing a near coin-flip chance of a half-point increase in December, against another three-quarter point move.

Current market pricing also indicates the fed funds rate will top out near 5% before the rate hikes cease.

The fed funds rate sets the level that banks charge each other for overnight loans, but spills over into multiple other consumer debt instruments such as adjustable-rate mortgages, auto loans and credit cards.

Listen, Zuck MIGHT be an absolute regard and Meta MIGHT be the downfall of his company, but I hardly believe that’s the case. Take VR-chat for example, I have seen lots of people compare meta with vr-chat pointing out that there already is an existing product that currently, beats meta in regards to graphics and so on. But meta was and isnt meant to be like vr-chat. Vr-chat didnt change gaming or gaming trends in basically any shape or form. We still use our systems and most of us would never switch to vr when we have pc and other standard gaming consoles. So why would meta try to create an already existing product, which has proven to not be very successfull? Well I think the answer is simple, they’re not doing that. The massive spending everyone is constantly reffering to is obviously not spent on the graphics or how it ”looks”, but the engine and the software, that currently (as shown by vr-chat), is very underdeveloped. The product isnt and was never meant to be operational or used right now, but everyone seems to think that because of the massive spending, bad graphics and an unfinished product, meta is DOOMED. I believe that there is profound potential in the metaverse because of the massive spendings, not the other way around. People want groundbreaking technology that potentially could represent reality, but act suprised when it turns out the cost of such a system to be built, is massive. Regarded sheep mindset.

Rates in have to be above the rate of inflation. 

For example, if you get a mortgage at current rates, about 7% and the rate of inflation is at 8.1%, you are borrowing money at a rate that is lower than inflation, which is not considered restrictive, or that it is stiil cheaper to borrow vs the appreciation of a commodity or asset.

The dilemma that jpow faces, is the time lag theory, which states that for each rate hike, it takes at minimum 6 months for for it to effect in the economy. The totality of  the effects of the rate hikes will really not be known until mid 2023. So no one really knows what the actual effects of hikes will do.

3.) Risk assets have rallied during the last weeks

22,wallstreetbets,ismokenct,self.wallstreetbets,78,Why do people buy Apple so much?,"I'm talking about Apple PRODUCTS

&amp;#x200B;

All apple products are pricey things, including the iPhone, mac, iPad and everything.

Yes they are excellent products with absolutely outstanding performances compared to other products out in the market. Still, yet a LOT of people who buy apple products can save a fortune by picking other products other than the standard MacBook or the iPhone. But yet they have so much market monopoly going on all over the world with such products that will normally be considered quite expensive, to the extent this is almost baffling

&amp;#x200B;

Apple grew AGAIN in the latest quarter
(While all the other major companies mostly had an earnings shock) and I personally think this can only be explained by ""People paying for apple products again and again."" If apple was a growing company aspiring to eat up a lot of the marketplace in the future then the reason for their growth would be pretty obvious. But they're not. It's not like they're starting to insert ads within the ios to increase their revenue. Their one and only source of profit is (mostly) their Apple products. Phones, Laptops, and Tablets that are more than outstanding in quality but also have a significantly higher price tag compared to other products.

It's making people buy the same iPhone again and more (well, not the same but you can still work longer with your previous iPhone.). I don't think Apple would be able to grow this much if people only bought a single iPhone to replace their previous iPhone every three years when their iPhone finally dies.  For some reason they're making the same people buy so much apple products again although their extremely high price tag. Something like buying another iPhone in a shorter span. Or buying other Apple products as well after purchasing your iPhone. Adding a new Macbook in your shopping cart although your previous one is still good.

Seems like people LOVE the iPhone. Yes it's a cult, it's almost something like a new religion

&amp;#x200B;

They don't really have a lot of new customers out there to purchase their first iPhone. Yet the company is still GROWING. A LOT

&amp;#x200B;

Is it the marketing? Is it because of product quality?

&amp;#x200B;

How is the company still GROWING?

24,wallstreetbets,predictany007,self.wallstreetbets,16,Amazon has exited the trillion-dollar club. Sell-off pushes market cap below $1 trillion for first time since April 2020," 

* Amazon’s stock closed down Tuesday for a fifth straight day, falling to the lowest since April 2020.
* Last week the company projected sales in the holiday quarter would be far below expectations.
* The stock dropped 5.9% to $96.79.
* Amazon has exited the trillion-dollar club.

Shares of the e-retailer plunged 5.9% on Tuesday, falling for a fifth straight day and closing at their lowest since April 2020. The sell-off has erased almost all of the stock’s pandemic surge.

Investors continued to punish the company for last week’s disappointing fourth-quarter forecast. Amazon said revenue during the holiday quarter would grow 2% to 8% over the year-ago period, far below analysts’ estimates. The cloud division, Amazon Web Services, also reported weaker-than-expected sales.

It’s the first time Amazon’s market cap has been below $1 trillion since April 2020. The stock has plunged 42% in 2022 and is on pace for its worst year since 2008, when it dropped 45%. The only other year that was worse was during the dot-com crash of 2000, when the company lost 80% of its value.

Like the rest of Big Tech, Amazon has struggled this year due to a slumping economy, soaring inflation and rising interest rates. On top of that, Amazon has been forced to scale back after expanding dramatically during the pandemic, now that consumers have returned to stores.

Amazon has been the second-worst performer in the Big Tech group this year, behind Facebook parent Meta, which has plummeted 72%. Meta told investors last week that revenue in the fourth quarter would likely decline for a third straight period.

33,wallstreetbets,live_rabbits,self.wallstreetbets,3,Insider Trading Weekly Update #012: Largest Trades + Sector and Market Cap Overviews + ***Public Workbook Update***,"GM WSB,

Captivating **TL;DR** today - **number go up.** Purchases are u**p 345% ($4.9M to $22M)** from the prior week along with sales, which increased +290% ($263M to $1B). The bulk of purchases stems from insiders at Mobileye Global Inc within the IT sector / Electronic Equipment industry. Active insiders and companies are up 18% and 25% respectively from the prior week.

# High-Level Stats:

* Purchases increased from $4.9M to $22M (+345%)
* Sales increased from $263.5M to $1.02B (+290%)
* Transactions increased from 267 to 316 (+18%)
* Companies represented in Form 4s increased from 170 to 200 (+18%)
   * Net buyers increased from 14 to 23 (+64%)
   * Net sellers increased from 156 to 177 (+13%)
* Insiders filing Form 4s increased from 234 to 292 (+25%)
   * Net buyers increased from 25 to 38 (52%)
   * Net sellers increased from 209 to 254 (+22%)

# Transaction Selection

1. **All** **Direct Open Market Transactions** from **October 24th - October 28th.** These are Form 4 filings with a Transaction Code of “P” or “S”. This narrows the scope to trades where insiders are putting their money on the line.
2. Weekly comparisons are to transactions from **October 17th - October 21st.**
3. **No companies without a ticker** (e.g. opportunity/income/mutual funds).

# Further Context

1. Form 4 data is impacted by a concept known as **backfill** which is par for the course with transactional data. The delay between the Filing Date and the Transaction Date is **\*roughly\*** 2 days and your mileage will vary. This means that **more transactions for past dates can arrive in future filings.** That is why looking at larger trends is key.
2. To combat backfill, filings through this Tuesday are included **\*if\*** the transaction date is from the prior week. Otherwise, transactions from this week are excluded.
3. Data is sourced by the algorithms behind [Form Fore](http://formfore.io/)

# Feedback/Updates

(TRULIEVE, VERANO, GREENTHUMB, CRESCO, CURALEAF) 

Ontario, Canada-based licensed cannabis producer Canopy Growth’s plans to launch Canopy USA to accelerate its acquisitions of three American marijuana companies and remain listed on a major stock exchange might have provided a blueprint for U.S. companies.

American cannabis operators who touch the plant could follow the Canopy road map to uplist from the Canadian Securities Exchange to the Toronto Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq – provided they’re willing to do a major restructuring, experts told MJBizDaily.

The upside to listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), North America’s third-largest exchange, is that it could help cannabis companies attract more institutional investment.

So far, American plant-touching cannabis companies – such as multistate operators – haven’t been able to raise capital on major exchanges because of the federal illegality of cannabis in the U.S., opting instead to list on the Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE) and over-the-counter markets.

And that might still be a problem, at least for the Nasdaq, which expressed objections to Canopy’s plans and could delist the Smiths Falls-based company.

But the TSX has been more receptive, which could provide U.S. plant-touching operators an avenue for uplisting without waiting for the federal government to legalize marijuana or implement other major cannabis reforms.

In an email to MJBizDaily, Catherine Kee, spokesperson at TSX parent TMX Group, confirmed that Canopy worked directly with the exchange and shared its plans in advance of the announcement.

Kee declined to comment on whether U.S. companies could follow.

“We are aware that legislation applicable to the marijuana sector is evolving,” Kee said. “TMX continues to monitor the developments with interest and we remain committed to supporting the enduring success of the cannabis industry.”

In a note, equity analyst Owen Bennett of New York-based investment bank Jefferies Group wrote that the Toronto Stock Exchange’s approval of a Canopy listing could have major implications for U.S. operators through more M&amp;A by Canadian acquirers and/or enabling “U.S. (operators) to adopt the same structure and uplist to the TSX.”

Restructuring ‘gymnastics’
Kelly Fair – a partner with the international law firm Dentons and external counsel to Canopy’s new holding company Canopy USA – told MJBizDaily she’s proud of the creative approach she and the Canopy team have taken to accelerate U.S. market exposure.

Canopy USA will have a ring-fenced structure in which Canopy Growth would hold nonvoting, exchangeable shares in the holding company, segregating those U.S. assets from the rest of the company.


“To the extent that the substructure is embraced by at least the TSX, then that would provide the opportunity to the U.S. (multistate operators to uplist) potentially sooner than a full legalization event – if they wanted to go through the gymnastics to do structuring like this,” Fair said.

Any MSO looking to uplist would have to create a ring-fenced structure between the listed company and the company that’s actually touching the plant or holding the plant-touching entities, she said.

The pros and cons

Matt Karnes, founder of Greenwave Advisors, told MJBizDaily via email that the TSX is more expensive to list on than the CSE, but that it has more liquidity and more stringent listing requirements – which are both more appealing to institutional investors.

He also said Canopy could try to use TSX approval to pressure the Nasdaq to allow U.S. plant-touching businesses to list.

Another hitch, however, is whether Canopy’s auditors will sign off on consolidated financials that include plant-touching operations in the U.S.

“The Big 4 (accounting firms) have not engaged in U.S. cannabis thus far and this could signal a willingness to accept U.S. cannabis clients – a positive for U.S. cannabis as it gives added assurance to institutional investors as to the industry’s legitimacy,” he said.

Whatever happens, Karnes  believes U.S. multistate operators will follow Canopy’s lead, particularly if they don’t want to wait for legislation such as the Safe and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act that could pass during this lame-duck session of Congress.

“I think whatever path Canopy Growth USA takes, the MSOs will follow, and they don’t necessarily have to wait to see what happens with SAFE.”

38,wallstreetbets,Suspicious-Word-9514,self.wallstreetbets,19,"Macroscope | The Fed meeting preview: 4th 75bps rate-hike is on the way, is pivot coming next?","The Fed's two-day November meeting will end on Wednesday, and the market has well expected its fourth consecutive aggressive 75 basis point rate hike, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. The probability of a 75 basis point rate hike has reached as high as 85.5%, which would raise the federal funds rate to a range of 3.75%-4%, the highest level since 2008.

However, given the recent signals released by the Fed to slow down interest rate hikes, the market is likely to be more concerned about further signals from the Fed after the rate meeting on plans for a December rate hike and the direction of monetary policy next year. The Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has been vocal about the need to slow the pace of interest rate hikes at some point since July, and analysts believe he may also reiterate that point at this meeting. Additionally, a report by the ""New Fed Wire"" last week about the possibility of a slowdown in the Fed's aggressive policy in December continued to gather steam, with medium and long-term US bond yields topping out after hitting yearly highs.

Bloomberg economists said what is less certain is how Powell will communicate a potential future downshift in the rate-hike pace -- the degree of conviction, the risks around hike sizing, and implications for the terminal rate. Economists expect Powell to use 50 basis points present a 50-basis-point move as the base case and clarify that a downshift in the pace of rate hikes does not necessarily mean a lower terminal rate.

It is worth noting that the Fed’s November meeting is also just less than a week before the US mid-term elections. Undoubtedly, how to deal with the Republicans on the high-rise inflation and the risk of recession will become a major problem for Biden. And just last week, two Democratic senators urged Powell not to cause unnecessary pain by over-raising interest rates.

It has been said that there are now major divergences within the Fed on monetary policy. For example, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daley thinks the Fed should start discussions on slowing down rate hikes to avoid sending the economy into an ""unforced slump"". But Kansas Fed President Esther George believes that monetary policy needs to move into a restrictive range, and the strength remains to be watched. Given the recent volatility in the financial markets and the time it takes for interest rate hikes to affect the economy, the Fed cannot act too hastily.

There are also a few views that do not favour a pivot. Fed governor Michelle Bowman hopes to look for signs of falling inflation before slowing down the rate hike. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said he hopes to raise the policy rate to a level that would put meaningful downward pressure on inflation.

Therefore, for this meeting, FOMC members are expected to engage in a heated debate on how to steer interest rates to avoid a troubled economy.

“They may want to go slower just in the interest of financial stability,” said Julia Coronado, the founder of MacroPolicy Perspectives LLC. “It’s a challenge for messaging because they don’t want to ease financial conditions significantly. They need tight financial conditions to keep cooling the economy off. So he (Powell) doesn’t want to sound dovish, but he may want to go slower.”

Some institutions took a relatively cautious view. Nomura believes that the FOMC does not yet seem to have a consensus on the preferred size of a December rate hike, which will limit Powell's ability to provide guidance. The Fed chairman will reiterate that future policy will depend on economic data, including the two non-farm payrolls reports and, most importantly, the latest inflation data. Barclays also released a report saying that the Fed may leave its December policy options open, pending more information on inflation and tightening risks.

The [J.P. Morgan](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NYSE-JPM/) team, on the other hand, made relatively “accurate “predictions on the outcome of this meeting. Analysts believe the most likely scenario going to happen is a 75 basis point rate hike and a hawkish press release, which could allow Powell to retain selectivity for December and next year meetings, while highlighting the current risks of higher inflation. In this scenario, S&amp;P 500 may float between down 1% to up 0.5%. And if the Fed provides clear guidance for the December meeting, this is likely to be seen as dovish and S&amp;P 500 could rise by 2.5%-3%.

In addition, former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers also tweeted recently, saying that the “growing chorus” for the Fed to pause interest rate hikes very soon is “badly misguided.” In his view, the Fed should stick to its current course and not pause too soon, especially given that it has a history of “past errors”.

Aside from rate hikes, let's not forget the glooming recession hanging over the US. Concerns were fuelled last week by the inversion in the 3-month/10-year US bond yields. Prior to this, the 2/10-year US bond inversion had been going on for almost five months. Given the historically extremely high success rate of both yield curves in predicting crisis, there is growing concern about how the Federal Reserve will respond to outside concerns about the economy.

Notably, Jerome Powell had said in the press conference after the September meeting that the goal of fighting inflation had not changed and would be maintained until the task completed, and the federal funds rate would need to be kept at a restrictive level for a certain time. But the FOMC had already revised down the US economic growth rate to 0.2% this year.

It is worth noting that while consumers, the engine of the US economy, are still maintaining spending in the face of inflationary pressures, danger signals are beginning to reveal. The US Department of Commerce said last week that consumer spending growth slowed to a near two-year low of 1.4% from 2.0% in the previous quarter, and consumer purchasing power continues to retreat at a 3% rate and US families are gradually running out of federal financial subsidies in the COVID pandemic.",0.79,11,0,11,question,2022-11-02T14:27:47Z,yk3wmu,t3

Camerco claims:

Uranium inventories are low

Secondary supply is low

Nobody has been investing in supply

‘never started a cycle with this high of a uranium price’

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Camerco appears to be a good steward of capital and understands the market dynamics involved with being a supplier of a not-so-rare mineral

Camerco had \~10% of world uranium production in 2021

China adding \~150 nuclear power plants by 2035

China’s nuclear power generation in the past 10 years has been so great - that it has made up for Europe’s staunch stance on decommissioning - leading to the largest nuclear power plant power generation of all time in 2021. It is conceivable that the west is beginning to realize their mistake and are beginning the process of fixing it, out of necessity from Russia’s and Saudi Arabia’s oil cartel.

Yes, oil manufacturing is going to spike. Oil supply will eventually outpace demand, the Russian war will end, and energy prices will stabilize…but with China investing so much into low-cost energy, will the west want to remain dependent on Russia for economic stability?

Even the most anti-nuclear governments are temporarily halting their decision to decommission 30 year old plants

200 - 400 nuclear power plants to be decommissioned by 2040

Camerco recently announced a deal to buy Westinghouse..

…and Poland just announced they’re building their first nuclear power plant and chose the U.S. and Westinghouse to build their first Nuclear Power Plant.

According to [World-nuclear.org](https://World-nuclear.org): 

About 90 power reactors with a total gross capacity of about 90,000 MWe are on order or planned, and over 300 more are proposed. Most reactors currently planned are in Asia, with fast-growing economies and rapidly-rising electricity demand.

&amp;#x200B;

Major uranium miners are seeing a demand increase in Uranium out to 2024 - and are subsequently significantly increasing production, including Camerco

Many western governments have started initiatives to support nuclear initiatives

Last quarter financial results showed negative earnings because they wrote off the expanse of restarting a mine. They previously shut the mine off due to poor uranium market performance.

Their main competitor is also increasing uranium production. They are both doing so based on contracts they’ve obtained and plan to obtain - neither seem to participate in the spot market in a material way.

&amp;#x200B;

Technically speaking, $CCJ has begun trying to break out of a major downtrend going back to 2014.

$CCJ Reiterated multiple times that they see strong profit going forward, and see production along with spot rates increasing. Given this, the Russian - Saudi oil regime, China's emergence as the nuclear energy super power, a massive reversal in short-term power plant decomissioning, the global incentive to go nuclear (Low long term cost, removal of complete reliance on oil, 'going green'), and  the material fact that Western governments have begun to spend money supporting this thesis...

&amp;#x200B;

Do you guys have any thoughts?

&amp;#x200B;

I'll leave with a headline I found:

Article dated: 6 Oct 2022

# No nuclear power ‘renaissance’ as Europe wrestles energy crisis

""...But after eight months of fighting in Ukraine, and an energy crisis compounded most recently by the alleged sabotage of the arterial Nord Stream 1 and 2 Russia-to-Europe pipelines in the Baltic Sea, European governments long opposed to nuclear power have shown only incremental shifts in their attitudes, which have been informed by years of concerns about nuclear waste and safety.

&amp;#x200B;

A wider pivot has remained absent.

&amp;#x200B;

“We’re not talking about a nuclear renaissance, as such,” Nicolas Berghmans, an energy and climate expert at the France-based Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations (IDDRI), told Al Jazeera, “but maybe more of a change of tide.”

&amp;#x200B;

“A real nuclear renaissance would be if Europe decides to invest in more nuclear power plants.”""",0.83,8,0,8,dd,2022-11-02T10:50:05Z,yjzuta,t3

Just a quick edit: [M2 Money Stock over the last 60 years](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL)

u/Infamous_Sympathy_91 's [post on credit card debt and personal savings from earlier today](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yjowp1/us_personal_savings_near_historic_lows/)


In 2020 money stopped moving. I wrote this in some of my previous posts and comments. In order to prop up economic activity, central banks increased money supply with almost 0 interest a.k.a Brrrrrr.

So ideally fresh minted money is distributed in the real economy and moves up and trickles down and so forth. As you can see in the chart above, money hasn't been moving as much in the economy since the peak in 2000; It's in constant decline with a hard fall in 2020.

Today central banks are trying to battle inflation. As you can see in the chart above, money isn't moving as much, so it's not that there is too much money in the real economy. Whatever they printed in the last 2 years went up to the big black void of finance. All the derivatives market, swaps, trenches and all sorts of made up bullshit has sucked up money faster than your wife sucking her boyfriend's cock.

Inflation is a product of price gauging and artificial crises, such as cutting down oil production, slowing down logistics around the globe, lagging or harsh response to the pandemic by governments etc.

What you're seeing with the interest rate increases will only hit small businesses and working people. Casino always wins. Banks will own everything. You will own nothing at the end of this.

In the next two years, you will lose your jobs, you will lose your homes if you have debt. You will start selling your assets until capitalism owns your ass. We had reached a point of multi-generational wealth with too many high net worth individuals. Those who are pulling the strings are actively sabotaging the economy and are robbing you.

The interest rates will once again go down, when most people lose everything and you can't borrow anymore. This isn't about bringing the inflation down by decreasing money spent in real economy. The chart in the link clearly shows you that there is no increased activity which would increase velocity of money.

So tomorrow or in the next year don't get your hopes up too much. Your average working class ape is in more debt than before and savings are at an all time low. The latest surge in house prices also guaranteed that banks and through them the central banks owns you.

This is the final stage of capitalism. Good luck to you all.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%. (Stats as of 2022-10-28)",0.8,12,0,12,dd,2022-11-02T03:10:54Z,yjr9oh,t3

So you like to make money fast? Is your motto Lambo or food stamps? This it’s for you. At 2 PM ET FOMC announcement made. A large price movement occurs at this time , this movement creates a fair gap value , as Powell starts to speak at 2:30 ET a counter move starts to test price movement created at release of hike announcement occurs. This can easily 2x-4x your 0 dte SPY option if it goes well if it doesn’t you lose 100% of your initial gamble I mean investment. This same pattern has occurred for the last two years . It doesn’t guarantee that it will happen again. Risky scalp with large potential for profit/losses. Just to reiterate if price has a large move up at 2 pm ET than just before 2:30 ET buy puts, if price has a large move down at 2 pm ET than just before 2:30 ET buy calls .

11,wallstreetbets,DaddyDersch,self.wallstreetbets,48,"11-1-22 SPY/ ES Futures, Apple and Tesla Daily TA","It was the night before FOMC and all through the markets there was oddities… I had mentioned last night actually in my TA that I expect at some point markets were going to get shocked by a big drop intraday instead of this recovery rip… that day was today. 

The interesting thing about today is that VOLD (volume) actually came in bullish at open and through the whole day pretty much until right before power hour VOLD was actually in extreme bull momentum. Now SPY could not break out and break away from 385 level. The thoughts are we either watched markets be held up by volume or there was just some weird stuff going on today. There was some dark pool prints hitting the tapes again today. 

The other interesting thing that I noted today is that this is the first time that the day before FOMC the VIX has been red (and especially didn’t spike) since the June FOMCs. The last two FOMCs were the first with a spike of the VIX the day before. 

What does that mean ? well im not quite sure but those months of FOMC were more bullish. 

&amp;#x200B;

We also have quite a few articles released today saying that Biden supports a pivot of the fed (this was later slightly walked back though). 

My initial thoughts on what to expect tomorrow is that JPOW drops a 75bps (I would be SHOCKED to see a 50bps) but then he should hint at a “we will remain data dependent but there is a case to slow hikes if we continue to see optimism and to fully evaluate the effects of rate hikes.” 

But tomorrow will be interesting to say the least!

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ig9cg0t6hex91.png?width=773&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=358cc3b9af8b4e8c28541c1fa6b63f0f176b3cad

This TA is going to be pretty brief as markets gonna move however the algos want it to with FOMC. 

But overall we did attempt to breakout over 390.1 resistance of the green channel. With that pretty stout rejection we are not finding support which we did find almost all day at 385. This could if we get a green day tomorrow also be seen as a nice daily 8ema/ 50ema support test. In addition I am seeing that the 8ema is crossing back over the 50ema (bullishly) for the first time in two months. 

The rejection at 390.1 also was a rejection of the daily 100ema which im not super surprised by as this level is usually a bigger fight. Markets will need the push from good FOMC news tomorrow to break through these key levels and breakout until CPI. 

Key support- 380.1 -&gt; 377.8 -&gt; 374.1

Key resistance- 388.6 -&gt; 390.1 -&gt; 393 -&gt; 397.8 (my potential target for a bullish FOMC)

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at futures we have actually had this pattern play out just last week where we found support and managed to push up for an extreme green day. 

With a rejection of that 200ema today and that 3925 level that will remain key resistance and we will look for that level to be closed over tomorrow to continue to be bullish. 

Key support- 3845 -&gt; 3800

Key resistance- 3885 -&gt; 3925 -&gt; 3975

Apple has nearly retraced all the way back to where it was Friday before that massive rip on earnings. I wish I woulda been smart enough to short it Friday at market close. Apple was able to back test and hold the daily 8/50ema support lines today, however fell and closed under the 100/200ema. 

Key support- 148 -&gt; 146

Key resistance- 153.4 -&gt; 155.7 -&gt; 157.4

Tesla actually had a pretty nice pop today and broke through (but failed to close over) a key level. I was mentioning as you can see that 205 to 230 red channel on tesla. With this break through I am actually looking at an upside move on tesla (despite FOMC). 

This is its first time its broken through key 230 resistance since October 7th. We still have not closed over 230 though but as long as tesla holds over its daily 8ema and continues to hold this red bull channel I will remain bullish on it. 

Key support- 230 -&gt; 224.8 -&gt; 219.2

Key resistance- 234.2 -&gt; 239.6

&amp;#x200B;

As I had mentioned this is the first FOMC since June that the VIX has not popped significantly the day before. To me this means markets are bullish. I think that anything super hawkish for the FOMC tomorrow especially if he says 75bps in December the VIX is going to spike like no other and we could very well end up with a huge red day. However, I remain bullish and I think JPOW wont say anything to tip the markets down tomorrow. 

10% challenge-

Overall today was yet again another untradeable day after the first big move. Was able to get some nice scalps in today. And with an average down on my SPY and Tesla puts this morning at open I was able to close the SPY level to level puts for green and close the Tesla level to level puts for a smaller loss (they were very red at open). I don’t like DCAing to win a play like that but I didn’t expect that massive pre-market and with SPY holding under and beginning to dump off the key 390.1 resistance at open I felt confident in the DCA.

TLDR for my fellow apes:

\- A scientist started mapping multiple countries' claimed economic growth numbers to the increase in city lights seen from satellites

\- He found a high correlation between the two in democratic countries that had a free press and independent parties measuring the numbers

\- He found a large discrepancy between the two in autocratic regimes that controlled the reporting agencies and the press (shocker!)

\- Tested his theory against reasons why totalitarian countries might have fewer lights when experiencing massive economic growth (hey! they like working and living in the dark! They're allergic to electricity! They care more about the environment!). Nothing seemed to stand up to scrutiny.

\- Based on the growth in lights, he estimates that China's growth was less than half what they claimed. This means that China's GDP is likely less than half of the US rather than nearly equal

\- The other side of the coin is that their total debt levels might be between 600-700% of GDP rather than 300%

\- Paper has been peer-reviewed and presented at multiple economic conferences

I know it's pretty mind-blowing to think China might actually lie about something like this given their honest and transparent dealings to date but you have to admit the science is pretty spiffy.",0.87,394,0,394,news,2022-11-01T22:09:25Z,yjjsm5,t3

TLDR- we could go higher but we have more uncertainty in the near future as opposed to the last 2 weeks.

Some important dates to keep in mind:

Nov. 2nd- FOMC day

Nov. 10th- Oct. CPI data

Cant post the chart cus VisualMod keeps on taking it down.

Simple as seeing the last bear market rally and then applying it to now. We saw a rising wedge form on the monthly chart which is happening now. If the fed says it will indeed be ""kinder and gentler"" in any way shape or form you better bet your bottom dollar we will go to 408. However, on the off chance, the Fed says it will continue to bring more pain all your calls will be worthless in a few days. Now keep in mind that Oct. CPI will also determine if we continue to keep going higher even after a Fed ""pivot"". If CPI comes in hot we could see a similar drop back down to 350.

My plan- Wait till FOMC to see if the fed is indeed going to be kinder and gentler. If so buy $400 calls then take out my initial before CPI and if CPI is hot buy $360 puts.",0.64,7,0,7,dd,2022-11-01T21:44:03Z,yjj173,t3

How to use this in your trading? 

Do you think **DASH** will move more than 14% by Friday? If not, sell options. If you think it will move for than that, I guess you might want to go long (debit) an option (not recommended). 

Do you want to trade **INTC**? Notice how the put\_IV is double that of calls. That means traders are bidding up the puts, and bidding down the calls relative to each other. If you think its going up, sell those puts and buy the calls. 

Want to trade **SBUX**? Realize that you will lose roughly 2% immediately when filling your trade and another 2% immediately when you exit. This is how the bid/ask spread works.

* The comments do not necessarily signal any pending actions against TikTok.
* The Treasury and Justice Departments are the ones leading a review and negotiations with the company.

Shares of U.S. social media companies Snap and Meta spiked on the news that a Federal Communications Commissioner said the U.S. government should ban TikTok.

“I don’t believe there is a path forward for anything other than a ban,” Republican Commissioner Brendan Carr told Axios in an interview.

Snap shares were up 6% and Meta shares were up 4% Tuesday afternoon.

The comments from Carr, one of four current commissioners at the Democrat-led agency, do not necessarily signal any pending actions against TikTok.

The Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS) in the Treasury Department is reviewing the company’s potential national security implications, given its ownership by a Chinese company, ByteDance. And the Department of Justice is the one leading negotiations over a security deal, The New York Times reported in September.

Concerns over TikTok’s potential security risks are generally bipartisan. Both the Trump and Biden administrations have expressed concerns and reviewed the company’s relationship with its Chinese owner. TikTok has maintained that it stores U.S. user data outside of China so that it would not have to turn over that information to the government, but U.S. officials have maintained their skepticism.

“Commissioner Carr has no role in the confidential discussions with the U.S. government related to TikTok and appears to be expressing views independent of his role as an FCC commissioner,” a TikTok spokesperson said a statement.

All this being said you must remember Logitech is a much larger company approx. 80 times the size of Turtle Beach. with a **much greater range of products.**

Sounds like Turtle Beach needs to create a much diverse range of products to compete... Well that's exactly what they have been doing although they didn't realize the recession was just around the corner.

78,wallstreetbets,predictany007,self.wallstreetbets,38,President Biden to float windfall tax on U.S. energy producers. Do you think it will affect energy stocks?," 

* Shares of refiners, oil producers drop after news report
* AP reported windfall tax is being considered by White House

President Joe Biden will call on Congress to consider tax penalties for oil and gas companies accruing record profits, according to a White House official, amid stubbornly high gasoline prices that are dragging on Democrats’ midterm prospects.

This could include a so-called windfall profit tax -- which Democrats have been proposing for more than a decade without success. The idea has renewed attention among progressives in Congress after gasoline prices spiked to more than $5 a gallon this summer.

Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat and Biden ally who chairs the tax-writing Finance Committee, has floated a proposal that would impose a new federal surtax on oil companies that record a profit margin better than 10%.

The White House official didn’t confirm that Biden would specifically call for the windfall tax after AP reported earlier Monday that he would. Biden will press oil and gas companies to invest their profits in lowering costs for Americans, the official said.

The president is scheduled to deliver remarks Monday afternoon, according to the White House, on “reports over recent days of major oil companies making record-setting profits even as they refuse to help lower prices at the pump for the American people.”

Biden also could reiterate his request for Congress to eliminate a slew of tax incentives enjoyed by the industry, including a deduction of intangible drilling costs, which allows oil and gas companies to immediately deduct some expenses, such as labor, site preparation and repairs.

Administration officials have weighed a number of other steps to encourage oil refiners to keep more gasoline and diesel inside the US, instead of exporting it, as domestic stockpiles shrink ahead of winter. New restrictions on the export of finished fuels, including diesel, could be imposed administratively.

Oil industry trade groups have argued a windfall tax would penalize domestic energy and fuel production right when the US should be encouraging more of both.

“Rather than taking credit for price declines and shifting blame for price increases, the Biden administration should get serious about addressing the supply and demand imbalance that has caused higher gas prices and created long-term energy challenges,” American Petroleum Institute President and Chief Executive Officer Mike Sommers said in a statement.

“Today, the president is proposing to raise taxes on the U.S. natural gas and oil industry that is competing globally to produce the fuels Americans need every single day.”

The S&amp;P 500 Energy Index initially erased a 2% gain after the news broke but partially recovered trading up 0.9% at 2:04 p.m. in New York. Refining stocks led the declines.

The Biden proposal resembles measures that politicians across Europe, and in some other countries such as India, are imposing on companies reaping record profits from fossil fuels and power generation. Mostly, those governments are using cash raised from windfall taxes to help subsidize soaring energy bills for households.

Critics of such plans say they’ll deter companies from making the kind of investments that are crucial for increasing supply, and keeping prices down, in the future -- a charge that may have more traction in the US, which unlike most European countries is itself a major oil and gas producer.

According to the SEC’s order, Compass repeatedly assured investors in 2017 that a technology upgrade at its Goderich mine – the world’s largest underground salt mine which is located near Ontario, Canada, and hailed by the company as its crown jewel – was on track to materially reduce costs and boost its operating results starting in 2018. **Compass’s statements were misleading because they failed to tell investors that costs at the mine were increasing rather than decreasing, which substantially undermined the projected savings.** The SEC also found that Compass misled investors by overstating the amount of salt it was able to produce at Goderich.

The SEC’s order found that Compass violated the antifraud, reporting, and internal controls provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and various related rules.

EQT which was founded in 1888, is one of the oldest stocks. The majority of analysts (77%) are bullish on the energy company, and they expect the stock to rally 56% from there. Analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a report last month that ETO-Top's risk-reward setup was the ""best"" among its peers heading into the winter this year.

As Europe’s gas price skyrocketing for the year and oil price globally has risen substantially this year due to the war in Russia and Ukraine providing tight supply. Europe could be headed for tough winters for the next 10 years and the supply shortages are likely the keep natural gas prices on a volatile upswing. The EQT should be benefited from tight supply and strong demand from Europe.

General Motors comfortably beat earnings expectations last week, but revenue was slightly below expectations and it maintained its full-year outlook. Either way, GM reported profits a full 20 percent higher than expected, triggering the rally in GM shares. The stock rose 3.6% on earnings day and is up 6.8% in the three trading days since the results were released.

TDLR: this pump was fueled by Japanese QE, White House is increasing inflation along with Japanese. Fed will be more aggressive to win, we all know the fed don’t lose




so everyone n their mother thinks we’re up because “pivot rumors” reality is when the pivot news dropped, market went green for a few minutes then shat the bed and ran red. then a certain something happened that made us run green and started this rally. It was BOJ interventions. BOJ (bank of Japan) dumped a whopping 40-50 billion dollars that morning so they can save the collapsing yen. Granted they were and partially still in denial about the whole interference as far as I can tell but they do assure y’all that they are “monitoring the markets” and they balance sheet keeps shrinking at a rather rapid pace.

So far off my estimates (too lazy to go pull up balance sheet) but I believe it’s around 200 billion that they have dumped into the markets since “bottom” was in. to put this into perspective, QT is burning slightly under 100bil a month and these guys just wiped out 2 months worth of hard effort and pain that the fed was trying to inflict in around 3 weeks time.

And there’s no sign of them stopping….. 

Their balance sheet is slightly over a trillion so they can keep this going on for a while.


THE CONSPIRACY

This whole operation along with “pivot” rumors are all well too damn coordinated. First off, we won’t see a pivot, CORE cpi was flaming hotter than Japanese pornstars. core PCE while came under estimates; it is still rising and there’s no sign of slowdown. So ask me again, why would they pivot or even hint at a pivot? 
It’s well known the White House has been begging Powell to go easy this meeting because of the election and u bet Powell is not being swayed. If politics were to get involved Powell is a republican and he’s on his last term so if anything he’s delivering more pain. But we all know Powell is here for the American people so I think he’s just gonna do what he had already planned and that is to just do his job and crush inflation. This is his chance to go down in history like Volker did. So I think the White House likley phoned the Japanese and begged them to dump dollars or someshit idk but this was all too well coordinated of a pump. The treasury(White House) is issuing an extra 150bil in debt above estimates. They are all adding to inflation trying to counteract the fed ahead of the elections.


this is why even if Powell had 75bps planned he will be forced to go with 100bps. They can’t increase QT since it’s really very close to max in terms of liquidity drain vs bank reserves. leaving the only option as more aggressive hikes to fight off the democrats and Japanese coordinated attacks against the fed. 


I think even with 100bps it’ll take some time to bleed the Japanese dry if they keep fighting so we can go on for months green if BOJ is willing to drop all 1 trillion that it has but I’m pretty certain they’ll stop once the election ends cuz it is coordinated after all to just spoof the markets for better votes in favor of the democrats",0.75,35,0,35,question,2022-11-01T13:37:05Z,yj6djm,t3

There’s one inflation gauge that bucks the trend

The New York Fed’s often overlooked UIG believes US inflation is past its peak


Whenever there’s an economic consensus on anything, it’s worth considering how it might be wrong. There seems to be general agreement that inflation and rates will be higher for longer, and “team transitory” has been defeated. But what if we are at an inflection point on inflation? This is the question policymakers should be asking. By one key measure, inflation in the US has already peaked. In fact, it peaked in March, the same month that the Federal Reserve began raising the benchmark rate.

The New York Fed’s underlying inflation gauge has largely been ignored for decades. That’s understandable, and not just because of the snoozer of a name. There wasn’t any significant underlying inflation in the years after the global financial crisis. While the Fed and financial markets are fixated on the 2 per cent inflation target, the UIG isn’t primarily a level forecast. Its real value is in predicting inflection points. It correctly anticipated the lasting high inflation we are now observing. And while it’s still high, the UIG is suggesting it will be abating.

The media and the public are obsessed with the consumer price index, while the Fed’s target is based on the personal consumption expenditures index. Both can be “noisy”, since they include the prices of volatile items such as energy and food. But they are not the only price measures. The Atlanta Fed tracks nine other indices(opens a new window) for inflation that aim to strip out noise. They show inflation somewhere between 4.7 and 7.3 per cent in September.

Most of these gauges remove data to try to identify underlying inflation. Core CPI excludes energy and food costs, for example, while trimmed mean and median measures strip out components with the largest changes in prices to smooth out the index. But the risk with these indices is that they can miss large price moves — up or down — that could be a signal of inflation changing direction.

The UIG is constructed differently, removing noise rather than items from the index. The idea is that movements in trend inflation happen alongside related changes in the trends of other economic and financial factors. The index looks at moves in prices, the labour market, financial markets and the real economy every month and checks the historical data going back to 1995 to see if similar moves had previously lasted at least a year. If so, they are included in that month’s UIG and if not, they are filtered out as noise.

You really can’t use the UIG to forecast the level of inflation, as has sometimes been suggested(opens a new window). Where it matters is in showing when the inflation trend is changing, and on this it has a decent track record in both normal and unprecedented times. When CPI hit a peak in 2018, for example, UIG clearly showed the peak while core CPI and trimmed mean and median indices suggested inflation would continue rising. In mid-2009, UIG showed a trough in inflation while the other measures took another year to reach a nadir.
What about during the pandemic? Core CPI did a good job of signalling a bottom for inflation in mid-2020 before rising, but dipped in the third quarter last year, wrongly suggesting that inflation would come down. The trimmed mean and median inflation indices failed to indicate a shift towards higher inflation, showing a trough more than six months after CPI and core CPI.

UIG found a bottom roughly in line with headline CPI and then started a steady climb upwards, rightly ignoring the slump in the third quarter of 2021. Of these metrics, it provided the earliest and most reliable signal for a rise in underlying inflation.

The Fed is now looking for signs that trend inflation has peaked and that monetary tightening is bringing inflation back towards its target. Much to its alarm, core inflation dipped in the second quarter of this year before accelerating in August and September. Median and trimmed mean inflation have been on a steady upward climb, with no signs of stabilisation. But the UIG peaked in March 2022, stabilised at high levels and has been gradually falling since July.

All the different gauges for inflation suggest it is way above the Fed’s target. But we know monetary policy works with long and variable lags, and there is a danger overtightening could spark a recession. The central bank aims to look through transitory factors and set policy based on the underlying trend. The UIG shows the trend is finally starting to reverse course. With rates now restrictive, that suggests it’s time for Fed officials to consider slowing their tightening path.

**The top 2 challenges  and why they are going in favour of Bayer** 

**1) litgations 2) europe economy**

**European economy and the rise of the germans** 

**The dark winter**
- we all know European is heading into a difficult winter, although energy prices have gone down since i write this, it is no guarantee they will remain so. However, the germans are going to spend there way out of this winter and are poised to avoid a recession in 2023.

*it has already begun*

Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase. 



1) winter recession avoided 

https://m.ca.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/germany-dodges-recession-but-inflation-climbs-to-116-2811016

Why will it benefit the underlying stock? 

Spending - stocks go up in spending times bud. 

2) surprising growth,  will it be enough to outpace inflation ?  For 2023  Germany is likely to be okay, and Bayers product are essentials, during hard times Bayer makes money as well.

https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/short_news/germany-under-fire-for-canibalistic-e200-billion-investment/

3) relief plan makes  the EU  worried, if Germany avoid recession by spending, other European nations will want to follow the idea,  inflation cannot be controlled like this. EU therefore sounds the alarm and potential consequences, it is likely that not too many nations will follow suit in my opinion , Germany can afford to be spending, not many  European nations can, making Germany the exception, in fact if Germany being the biggest economy in Europe  makes it through, much of Europe will also make I through. 

The worried citi suggest the following 

*The proposals could cut 2 percentage points off inflation in the next year, according to Citi, but they are unlikely to prevent an economic contraction. The package “may soften the coming recession but also poses risks, in our view,” Citi analysts said in a note released last Friday.*

Why are we using words like economic contraction  all of a sudden instead of recession?

- **The litigations over roundup** and *glysophate*


 Bayer is still facing litigations due to the acquisition of Monsanto and RoundUp and during the last earnings call, Werner Baumann gave updated numbers. There are about 141,000 claims in total and about 108,000 have been settled.

Remember they have already set the cash aside, have won or litigated the majority of all cases. The rest are likely to head the same path.

Here is glysophate  surging 300% in 2021 https://www.agweb.com/news/crops/crop-production/glyphosate-prices-soar-much-300-and-thats-if-you-can-even-get-it

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king: 

Take a look at some of these charts in the past 59 years  have crop production globally  ever decreased over time ? Never, ever.

For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic.

&amp;#x200B;

trading rangebound af.  0dtes swinging +/-10% on pure delta.  theta is frozen.  buy puts on your preferred index/etf at any time.  depending on your risk tolerance and the underlying, open a limit sell order for 1.5x-3x.  pussy with spy itms? get ur +50%.  lunatic on some otm spx? go for that +200% in 5 minutes u fucking god.

&amp;#x200B;

PHASE 1: 2:00:00-2:05 

 

i dont even wanna talk about what to do if its not 75bps but just in case...

100bps: do some sick euphoric dance and start howling.  then remember u set a limit order and lose your mind as you watch your 1.5x turn into free millionaire tickets.

50bps: cry and hope jpow starts levitating and speaking in tongues.  or maybe ur a maniac with a 4100 spx call hedge in case jpow starts handing out bags of cash instead of having a press conference.

&amp;#x200B;

75bps:

instant sentiment analysis on fomc statement finds ""pivot language"" to be largely absent.  spy down 1% in seconds, maybe making it all the way to -2%. your low-return sell order goes off in 10 seconds.  you clench and maybe walk around in a circle for 5 minutes.  your longer shots sell.

&amp;#x200B;

PHASE 2: 2:05-2:33  

&amp;#x200B;

conflicting narratives enter the picture.  the gamma recedes.  hopefully you're back in cash.  maybe you're in shambles cuz ur greedy limit just had its balls tickled.  we catch our breath and say, 'hold on, lets see what pow pows gonna say.  why are we down?  it was 75bps like everyone predicted.  that was priced in.  that was an overreaction, grab up this discounted shit quick.'  

market churns and claws back some to all of phase 1 losses.  pow pow takes his sweet ass time walking up to the podium and clears his throat...

&amp;#x200B;

PHASE 3: 2:34-2:4X

&amp;#x200B;

i dont know really. probably not much happens.  powell on his prepared remarks.  maybe he throws a hawkish jab or two, or sprinkles some grass for the bulls. hold on to ur cash.

&amp;#x200B;

PHASE 4: 2:4X-EOD

&amp;#x200B;

this is where we set momentum into jobs on friday.  powell opens some q+a.  first q probably some random bullshit that pow pow deflects heroically.  then maybe another softball, maybe a few more.  then some legendary lunatic reporter grabs the mic and says, 'YO JEROME YOU FUCKING PIVOTING OR WHAT?' powell takes a moment to collect himself, then states with volume and conviction we shall not pivot.  

now we're at another crossroads.  i'd say market starts selling right the fuck off.  but maybe, just maybe, we irrational bastards are so impressed by jpows stalwart leadership that we collectively decide an economy helmed by such a man must be infallible and head off towards the moon.

you could be in position before this pivotal (fuck you) line of questioning, hoping to predict the market reaction or do a spread if ur into that shit.  or you could wait a few minutes after jpow drops the mic for the direction to become clear and jump on it.  we're not changing direction til mid thursday at the earliest.  i wouldnt even call you a pussy if you bought a thurs / fri exp instead at this point and sold it late on thurs.  if you go with a 0 day roll that shit sometime 3:30-EOD.  

at least 3 percent up or down close on wed and an additional 1-3% move in the same direction on thursday.  

&amp;#x200B;

thats it.  if you made it this far, congratulations! for even considering trading on this perspective, you are now a more degenerate member of society.  even if we strike it big, we're gonna lose it soon or spend it on food accented with gold flakes, caviar, and our own tears.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%. (Stats as of 2022-10-28)",0.86,19,0,19,dd,2022-11-01T02:09:57Z,yitajz,t3

But cause of all my past losses, I didn’t have the guts to press submit I just didn’t. And guess what, 2000% gains it went up 2000 frickin percent. I can’t believe I had it all was left just submit and at the end of day I could’ve gained 2000%. But I didn’t make it and I got even more scared cause I missed it cause I was scared. 

Anyway, today I was like I am not missing anything cause of fear, and I made two trades, both expired worthless so $600 is gone. 

I am sick of this. And it’s not like I just gamble. I calculate it and go for it, but I feel like the universe against me. Sometimes when I sell to break even it goes up later. And when I am like leave it let’s not just break even it will go up, no it goes down and down.

How do you deal with this and get back up and have guts to trade again.",0.78,20,0,20,question,2022-11-01T00:14:29Z,yiqme1,t3

What a frightfully boring day today was… This honestly was one of the worst choppy range days I have seen in months. The total range for today on SPY was $3.14… usually we see that level of movement on the opening candle of SPY. 

The question remains where are we headed? 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you to u/80hz14 for posting this in the chat today… as you can see we have a few possible scenarios and outcomes for Wednesdays FOMC meeting. Overall I would say I am in the 75bps hike and a dovish presser where jpow hints at a 50bps in December. I think we should see a 3%+ green day on Wednesday. I would be pretty shocked with rising inflation to see JPOW drop a 50bps but honestly it could happen for other reasons. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today we saw an extreme small range day (only 39% of the 10 day average) inside day that closed as a gravestone doji. With 388.6 remaining as resistance I will be looking for downside until SPY can break free and close over that resistance level. Today we did see that the 386/ 3880 level on futures was impressively strong support. Any time SPY came anywhere near that we would see a pretty impressive pop. 

Overnight and tomorrow those will be our clear “breakout/ down” levels. From there it depends on which way markets want take us. We very well could end up with an equally as annoying range day tomorrow. However, I wouldn’t be surprised to see a small pullback tomorrow down to the 380 range. The last few FOMCs the two days leading up to it have provided a small pullback. 

Key support- 385 -&gt; 380.1 -&gt; 378

Key resistance- 388.6 -&gt; 390.2 -&gt; 393

Futures also had an extremely choppy overnight and intraday today. However, its daily char is closing with a double top right at 3910 and just under the daily 100ema resistance of 3925. With holding that key support of 3770 all day today we will look to those two key levels tomorrow to guide us on what direction we are going to be headed tomorrow. 

Its not impossible to believe that markets could rally tomorrow with hopeful whispers of FOMC on Wednesday but the historical trend would point to slight downside (risk off) leading into FOMC.

Key support- 3870 -&gt; 3845 -&gt; 3800

Key resistance- 3925 -&gt; 3975

Not much of a surprise after that’s unbelievable Friday that Apple had we had a pretty nice pullback on Apple, although it looks more impressive than it actually was being that Apple only closed down 1.54%. 

Apple is at a key level right here fighting between the daily 200ema of 153.4 and the daily 100ema of 152.2. Historically when it comes to Apple interacting with the 200ema it is a fight that lasts for a few trading days as the daily 200ema on Apple is a major major pivot point. I have not seen too many times where it takes a straight trend line down or up over the daily 200ema. 

Key support- 151 -&gt; 148

Key resistance- 153.4 -&gt; 155.8 -&gt; 157.4

Tesla remains a tricky one to get a good read on, however, as you can see we are maintaining a pretty consistent red sideways consolidation channel from 205 to 230. We have now see our 4th day in a row of Tesla rejecting the daily 20ema and refusing to close over it. However, this is now the 4th day in a row that it has closed over the daily 8ema. As you can see we are in a pretty impressive red bull channel here, however, that blue resistance and red support lines are forming a really nice rising wedge. 

Until Tesla can breakout and most importantly close over the daily 20ema I remain bearish on it. My anticipation would be that we see a move one way or another tomorrow. Key support for that red bull channel is 224.8 tomorrow which is also the 3 day support line and previous resistance line. While its not impossible I would be surprised to see Tesla hold between 230 resistance 224.8 support. 

Key support- 224.8 -&gt; 219.3

Key resistance- 230 -&gt; 234.2

You gotta love the VIX this thing just defies all logic. I am actually surprised with FOMC in two days to see the VIX unwind more like it did today, however, the VIX actually had a really impressive spike at open and closed down with a nice inside day… one of those odd days where the 10year yield, DXY and VIX were all red and SPY was red. 

Some of the issue I saw today was that over all price action, volume and momentum opened pretty bearish this morning, however, the VIX continued to unwind and I believe that led to a lot of this choppy tight range price action. The VIX is currently holding right at the same level it was prior to last FOMC where the day before fomc closed at a VIX of 27.15. 

Overall no real sense of direction for SPY tomorrow as until FOMC happens the market in my opinion is not going to play nicely and not play by the technicals. 

FOMC day is setting up to be a really nice day for some nice wins, I have posted that TA and trade plan/ analysis. Make sure you give it a read! 

10% challenge-

Today was a really tough day for me today. Actual scalp wise I did do fairly well today, however, I had my level to level calls from Friday that I should have closed the Tesla calls green this morning (regrets) and I actually ended up closing them pretty early this morning when pretty much everything pointed to downside… only for them to pop up right after I closed them. If it wasn’t for those two woulda been a decent day despite the hard price action. 

I also thing that’s something that is going to catch this market by surprise here very soon and possibly even tomorrow for pretty much the last week or two now the price action of SPY in the mornings has been pretty bearish and has also been support by volume too. However, by 11ish we have seen a complete snap of trend and 180 reversal… today just chopped instead of broke out. I wonder if we get a slight sell off tomorrow as people get caught thinking its time to buy the morning weakness. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bpvi8i5on7x91.png?width=883&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a2874c15f1667138319a8a6f0de51c94dc5841f

Closing out my most profitable month of the year and also one that I do not plan to attempt to beat. Great month with some great plays. Keeping in mind that my average % gain per trade was still only 12.7% for the month. This wasn’t so much about getting random massive winners… though I had some nice wins in there too… it was more about consistent small gains that have added up over time and most importantly limiting downside risk with a -20% stop loss. 

I posted my article about that this weekend but something to keep in mind is that just because I use a -20% stop loss on my scalps doesn’t mean that is right for you. You have to find what works for your strategy and your overall profits/ trade. The whole theory is though that you can have an extremely successful strategy but if one loser wipes out all of your weeks profits or numerous days of profits then you need to manage your risk better. It’s a balancing act of having a lose enough stop to not stop out too quickly (especially on my level to level plays) BUT not having such a big stop loss that it hits and the loss takes numerous trades to overcome.

Mostly for my own records but I am going to starts separating my scalps and my level to level trades from eachother and this month of November I really wanna analyze the comparison of them and everything more closely.

90,wallstreetbets,predictany007,self.wallstreetbets,18,JPMorgan Says Dovish Fed Could Spark The S&amp;P 500 To Rally 10% In One Day.,"While hopes for a less aggressive Federal Reserve helped US stocks overcome last week’s flurry of disappointing earnings from tech giants, JPMorgan Chase &amp;. Co.’s trading desk now sees room for a massive rally should policy makers turn dovish when they announce their decision on Wednesday.

The S&amp;P 500 could surge at least 10% in one day if the central bank raises interest rates by a slower-than-expected half of a percentage point, and Chair Jerome Powell signals willingness at the press conference to tolerate elevated inflation and a tightening labor market, according to the bank’s sales team including Andrew Tyler. The scenario is the “least likely” to materialize, yet the “most bullish” outcome for equity investors, the team wrote in a note to clients on Monday.

Laying out every possible scenario on Fed day, the JPMorgan team is embarking on a high-stakes task of predicting market moves based on an event that has largely been positive for stocks this year. Of the six prior meetings, the S&amp;P 500 rose four times on Fed day and fell on the other two, according to Bloomberg data.

To be sure, the bank’s economists expect the Fed to boost rates by another three-quarters of a percentage point, in line with the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey, and Tyler’s team views other scenarios as less likely. Still, the exercise offers a lens into the risks that investors are grappling with.

“These outcomes are skewed to the upside as our view is that last week the market had every reason to retest lows given the disappointment from megacap tech earnings and still moved higher,” noted Tyler and his colleagues. “Several client conversations have focused on trying to identify who is the incremental seller; we think the risk/reward is to the upside.”

Below are the scenarios from the JPMorgan team on how the S&amp;P 500 could react on Fed day.

* 50 basis point hike, with a dovish press conference: “It is difficult to conceive of a scenario where this outcome occurs given inflation levels and a tight labor market,” the team wrote. “Should this outcome occur, the immediate reaction could produce a double-digit one-day return for equities.” S&amp;P 500 up 10% to 12%
* 50 basis point hike and a hawkish press conference: An outcome that could stem from a Fed that is increasingly concerned about financial stabilities as it balances growth and inflation. S&amp;P 500 up 4% to 5%
* 75 basis point hike and a dovish press conference: A scenario viewed as having the second-highest probability of playing out. “If you saw the Fed give explicit guidance for the December meeting, then that is likely viewed as a dovish outcome.” S&amp;P 500 up 2.5% to 3%
* 75 basis point hike and a hawkish press conference: “This is the most likely outcome with Powell retaining optionality for December and 2023 meetings while emphasizing the current risks to inflation moving higher.” The team also views this as the outcome most expected by bond markets, so says there may not be a significant move in yields that keeps equities from melting down. S&amp;P 500 down 1% to up 0.5%
* 100 basis point hike and a dovish press conference: While this is seen as unlikely as a 50 basis point hike, it may mean the Fed both wants a higher terminal rate and wants to complete the tightening cycle this year. “Separately, the market may digest this move as the Fed having prior knowledge of where next week’s CPI prints.” S&amp;P 500 down 4% to 5%
* 100 basis point hike and a hawkish press conference: Considered the best outcome for equity bears waiting for this latest rally to dissipate. “Here this would seem to be a Fed reassessing its own inflation forecasts, which some investors feel is too optimistic.” S&amp;P falls 6% to 8%, likely resting year-to-date lows.

Smith, Commissioner United States Securities and Exchange Commission before the American Bankers Association . . . , February 8, 1971 - when the NASDAQ began trading on February 8, 1971, as the world's first electronic stock market ""A Piece of Paper Revisited""","""What I want to discuss with you today is a piece of paper. It is nothing more than that, and yet it represents a great deal more. 

It is a piece of paper that vitally affects you and us and the entire financial community. It is also a piece of paper that despite being old and encrusted with a century or more of hoary legalisms has the most amazing, the most appalling reproductive capacity -- it procreates not merely subdivisions of itself but during the course of its life and travels generates an incredible number of relative pieces of paper, that cling to it, describe it, give it directions, authenticate it, transfer it, transform it, cancel it, encumber it. Like all relatives, these attachments are each very different and together very expensive.

The progenitor piece of paper to which I am referring, of course, is the stock certificate.""

\---

A lengthy read, that I'm too lazy to type it all out. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1971/020871smith.pdf)

Why did I come across this, some might ask? 

Well, I was trying to find out when stock market became electronic. Then I was wondering who programmed it.. 

Okay then, why am I curious about who programmed it?

I'm kindly regarded, hugely. But I still wonder things sometimes; If some of you are like me, and have been glued to these charts past 2'ish years - there's a kind of relative thing happening.. I can't quite describe it but as a uh, prolonged barrel-rolling sewing machine pattern, if that makes sense... and it's not 'making' something it's .. well, sort of seeding a landscape we're looking at from top-down..

Which got me to the wondering part, who was it that programmed the NASDAQ initially? 

6oo6ling that specific Q got me nothing so I broke down what I could possibly render a reasonable direction from: computer/software companies in the 60's

A few things stood out to me - IBM, Fortran, and [Harlan Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills) 

IBM because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then. 

"" In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than [4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1946%E2%80%931959:_Postwar_recovery,_rise_of_business_computing,_space_exploration,_the_Cold_War) were IBM machines. ""

&amp;#x200B;

[Fortran](https://emmachev.com/what-is-the-difference-between-pascal-and-fortran-programming-languages/) because it is a procedural, imperative, general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations. After IBM developed it in the 1950s, it soon gained popularity in programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then Harlan Mills. Just look at his timelines and titles. Specifically -  

* Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1975–81

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my thinking.. SEC knew then what we know now. Banks are assholes doing asshole stuff (if you read more of ""A Piece of Paper Revisted"" (see way above). And they figured, well, if we get rid of the human element (to some degree) this might make things more legit for more ppl than less of them. 

IBM is a huge, American computer company. Invest in America, it was the 50's/60's afterall. We were boomin' baby. And they have this Fortran language that handles all kinds of processes. Then we have Harlan Mills - I mean for all what was going on above... he has a suspiciously obvious time gap.. then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth.. pretty sus cuh.

&amp;#x200B;

All right, you've gotten this far in my rabbit hole. 

Along my tinfoil travels, I came across this other dude [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Early_years) \- he apparently influenced Harlan Mills - As an IBM research fellow, Mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development. These included automata theory, the structured programming theory of Edsger Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, and others, and Markov chain-driven software testing.

But what got me in Dijkstra's 'Legacy' section was the [Banker's alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) \- 

The Banker algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an ""s-state"" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

And this is when I came full circle on the part above I was trying to describe at ""I'm kindly regarded."" 

Anyway, this rabbit-hole kinda tripped me out. Figured a share.

He was a former military leader with the support of the military and in the past has spread the sentiment that he isn't leaving. I wanted exposure to the instability of the country so I bought puts in an ETF there for after the transition of power in the new year. The Brazilian market is generally up today on Lula's victory but I think the instability is not priced in. I chose the ETF EWZ as it has a higher finance exposure which should be the first sector to hurt. I see at least some instability and at most a Coup d'état.

A few weeks back, I mentioned the bounce was coming here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading\_spy\_next\_9\_days/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading_spy_next_9_days/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  and here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading\_spy\_week\_of\_oct\_17th/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading_spy_week_of_oct_17th/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  

Lets review the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November. 

What other macro trends do you think I missed? 

PS. if you don't want to short the market, short TSLA. Its the most obvious play out there.

A friend once said and i paraphrase ' The techs can not rise unless the semis get bullish 'i sure hope this is the beginning of the Rally to 4200-4500 we keep hearing about .i made a lot of money in semis the last three weeks but perhaps i took profits too early. A volatile lot to be sure and i don't own at present . If the broader market stays bullish i will buy back on a dip . Need to see strength from other techs first.   


i called this Q4 semi rally way back in early October and the Semis bottomed on October 13th . So i feel like the Semi sector now needs the rest of the tech market to participate in order for a post mid term rally to materialize .   


having said that, i think the market typically rallies 16% on the following 12 months post midterms so its a now or never event just in front of us.

I’m only a year old member of the page, but thought i’d share my thoughts because while this page is fun, it can also be toxic at times and not overly helpful or insightful. That being said, there are plenty of times I have seen positivity and  insight. I’m not a professional at this at all, but thought i’d share my thoughts after my first year of trading options…. But first here was my trade today:

I took a short position (bought puts) on TSLA towards the top of its 207-226 channel this morning. Took 2 contacts at 220ish. 1 additional contract at 223ish. I had my stop loss set, and then went to my actual job. The thesis was that it would get back to 207 support in short to mid term.


 I obviously got very lucky that TSLA severely underperformed today and happened to hit my target. I’ve always hung on to losers too long and winners too short, so i was sure to move my stop to break even when it moved my way, and then continually moved my stop up as the trade worked in my favor. Eventually got stopped out around 206 for $1,710. Felt nice because the risk reward was there, and everything made sense, obviously lucky that TSLA was weak with twitter debacle, but nice to have one go my way.


I’m now long two contracts as you can see above. Thesis is TSLA will return to 220s and stay within this channel in short to mid term. If i get stopped out monday, so be it, but the risk reward for me makes sense.


Things i’ve learned the last year: 


1. I can’t trade 0dte contracts. It’s straight gambling for me and i suck at that. I’m also too busy with my actual job to monitor trades like these which i assume require a high level of attention to detail. 3-4 Weeks minimum preferred for me.


2. The trade has to have a clear out front thesis that doesn’t evolve to fit your bias as the trade plays out.

3. Position sizing is so important for my financial and mental well being. I have to be sure to never risk more than a certain percentage of my portfolio. “Preserve precious capital” as a famous trader says makes sense to me


4. The better my mental and physical health the clearer my mind is with trading.


5. Mistakes happen. Basically blew up my account last fall when beginning options and while i hated myself, it taught me a lot about myself, and my tendencies.

6. I prefer to stick with one stock and listen to a few youtubers i like that analyze it. Simple things like supply and demand level, rsi and macd, and paying attention to fed news and the indices.

I’m not an OG here, but thought i’d share my thoughts and a positive trade i made as i continue to grow and improve. Maybe the mods will remove, idk. TGIF


TLDR: i have learned the hard way about risk management, having a real thesis before trades, and avoiding theta decay/ giving myself time on trades by picking better (in my opinion) expiration dates. Also, if i can’t sleep or feel anxious after the closing bell, i know i am not sizing properly and over risking …

# Risk Analysis - Statistical Analysis

Taking in count the stock's price movement from 2002 to 2022, we have the following data:

|Expected Minimum Return|0.16%|
|:-|:-|
|Variance|0.26%|
|Standard Deviation|5.07%|

Taking in count the stock's price movement from 1st December 2021 to Today, 5th November 2022, we have the following data: 4739

Statistically Speaking, investing in GME has a high probability to give you a return around -5 and 5%, with 43.46% of the data population between -5% and 0 and 45.94% between 0 and 5%.

This gives us a 10.60% chance to get an outlier return from the historical data.

Standard Deviation suggests a 13.11% to ride on a price movement higher than 5% or lower than -5%. In the long run the chance of getting outlier is reduced to 5%.

The FED has raised rates to 4%, we will factor in a 4.50% rate instead.

# Final Comment

With its current amount of Cash &amp; Cash Equivalents and without any drastic changes in the company structure and business model, GME is expected to burn is cash within 35 Months. Taking in mind receivables and other liquidity, it still have 39 months remaining in operation.

The company can avoid this by taking more loans or selling parts of the company and other assets.

Company doesn't pass Acid Test, and it is in a dire financial struggle to survive.

Still expecting negative income and cash flow from operations for 2023.

Debt is not critical, this shall allows some room for a possible long term loan.

Current Cash can cover only 94% of current liabilities. The company should be able to cover it with receivables.

ROE, ROA, ROIC and ROC terrible.

ROE is in recover, so GG

ROIC worsen and ROA is stable

This suggest that, yes the management is trying to fix the company, with some positive outcome, but they are struggling a lot right now.

Income quality getting away from danger zone, but still in bad situations.

Gross profit margin worsened. Company cannot manage well costs, this is probably due to inflation and macro.

There are ""***Strategic and Operational Risks Related to Digital Asset Initiatives""*** *that can have huge positive impact as well as dire outcome if it fails. This is a huge risk factor.*

In the mid term, 1-2 years, the company shall gradually trade down from current price to $15 with possible spikes due to external factors. Expect (90% chance) movements between -5% and 5% cause historical price action with a 10% chance to cash in or go tits up.

Fundamentals point toward bankruptcy, but as for now, if the management play their card well there is a possibility to recover.

With current balance sheet, market  health and macro, the company is fucked up.

consider a stock that has experienced several highs and lows over the last year through both bullish and bearish trending patterns. A technical analyst using a Bollinger  channel may see that the price is approaching its support trendline. If the stock has a positive weighted alpha it can be an affirmation that the stock’s price has largely been gaining over the last year, **supporting another bulish push higher.**


**why is a European Germany company rising its revenue guidance when apparently Europe is gone to sh**t ? You will find out why it is my honest opinion that Warren buffets reasoning to buy when everyone fears is can be applied for Bayer**

The 2022, full year growth outlook raise  is significant, particularly in its crop science division;:

1. Now expecting a 10% previously 5% in the seed and crop protection market for 2022, driven high quality prices for seeds and crop commodities and inflation.

2. Pharmaceutical division to expand by 6% previously 5%

3.conhmsr health 5% from 4% 

**remember this is just by the end of 2022, if the conditions persist the growth outlook widens, it seems like  the basic needs or medication and crops are recession proof when picking the correct company**

**The top 2 challenges  and why they are going in favour of Bayer** 

**1) litgations 2) europe economy**

**European economy and the rise of the germans** 

**The dark winter**
- we all know European is heading into a difficult winter, although energy prices have gone down since i write this, it is no guarantee they will remain so. However, the germans are going to spend there way out of this winter and are poised to avoid a recession in 2023.

*it has already begun*

Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase. 



1) winter recession avoided 

https://m.ca.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/germany-dodges-recession-but-inflation-climbs-to-116-2811016

Why will it benefit the underlying stock? 

Spending - stocks go up in spending times bud. 

2) surprising growth,  will it be enough to outpace inflation ?  For 2023  Germany is likely to be okay, and Bayers product are essentials, during hard times Bayer makes money as well.

https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/short_news/germany-under-fire-for-canibalistic-e200-billion-investment/

3) relief plan makes  the EU  worried, if Germany avoid recession by spending, other European nations will want to follow the idea,  inflation cannot be controlled like this. EU therefore sounds the alarm and potential consequences, it is likely that not too many nations will follow suit in my opinion , Germany can afford to be spending, not many  European nations can, making Germany the exception, in fact if Germany being the biggest economy in Europe  makes it through, much of Europe will also make I through. 

The worried citi suggest the following 

*The proposals could cut 2 percentage points off inflation in the next year, according to Citi, but they are unlikely to prevent an economic contraction. The package “may soften the coming recession but also poses risks, in our view,” Citi analysts said in a note released last Friday.*

Why are we using words like economic contraction  all of a sudden instead of recession? 

https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/07/germany-relief-plan-could-trigger-uk-style-bond-meltdown.html
- **The litigations over roundup** and *glysophate*


 Bayer is still facing litigations due to the acquisition of Monsanto and RoundUp and during the last earnings call, Werner Baumann gave updated numbers. There are about 141,000 claims in total and about 108,000 have been settled.

Remember they have already set the cash aside, have won or litigated the majority of all cases. The rest are likely to head the same path.

Here is glysophate  surging 300% in 2021 https://www.agweb.com/news/crops/crop-production/glyphosate-prices-soar-much-300-and-thats-if-you-can-even-get-it

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king: 

Take a look at some of these charts in the past 59 years  have crop production globally  ever decreased over time ? Never, ever.

With crop production increasing, it drags along with it:  Crop Science 


BAYER AG  lifts forcast amid sustained boom in farming prices. crop science unit is major growth engine with price gain.

lawsuit:
Counter point and what investors should know :


For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic. This includes recent conclusions by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the EU’s Assessment Group on Glyphosate (AGG), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), and the leading health authorities in Germany, Australia, Korea, Canada, New Zealand, and Japan.

One of Bayer's core defenses in the litigation is that the EPA has decided glyphosate is not carcinogenic and not a risk to public health.",0.99,8,0,8,question,2022-11-05T02:48:48Z,ymfmmn,t3

I read online that a Form 25 has to be filed with US securities regulator SEC within 60 days of the first issue of proxy soliciting materials for voting on matters related to the buyout. This form certifies that the stock will be delisted by the exchange upon completion of the merger.

On September 02, Zendesk published the first round of proxy soliciting materials. The deal was then approved by Zendesk shareholders during a meeting on September 19. The Form 25 was now most likely has already been filed around November 02.

The Form 25 won't be made available to the public or be ""considered valid"" unless Zendesk issues a press release indicating completion of the deal, and that the exchange has received evidence of a certificate of merger from Zendesk. Upon all conditions being satisfied, the exchange removes the listing 10 days after the Form 25 becomes public. In 90 days, the SEC nullifies the registration of the securities. If Zendesk were to go public in the future, it would be assigned a new CUSP ID.

When a stock gets delisted as a result of a company going private, options are cash settled for the difference between the buyout price and the strike price.

Given that deals tend to be completed within a week of the Form 25 being drafted and confidentially submitted to the SEC, are you guys willing to risk $5 to buy 77 dollar call options expiring 11/11/2022 in anticipation of the deal closing next week?

# TLDR

Zendesk is incorporated in Delaware according to SEC filings.

If the status changes to an L (consolidated), the transaction has went through.

[https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/Ecorp/EntitySearch/NameSearch.aspx](https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/Ecorp/EntitySearch/NameSearch.aspx)

Zendesk apparently has a charitable foundation, and  the status for their charitable organization will likely change from Exempt to M (Merged) one day early before Zendesk Inc changes their status from General to L (Consolidated) .

**FILE         NUMBER ENTITY NAME**

5606971  ZENDESK CHARITABLE FOUNDATION

4661237   ZENDESK, INC.

[https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/Ecorp/FieldDesc.aspx#ENTITY%20TYPE](https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/Ecorp/FieldDesc.aspx#ENTITY%20TYPE)

It apparently costs 20 dollars each time I want to refresh the status of the entity or to check their filing history :(

Changing the status of a company from General to Merged takes about 2-3 weeks apparently, or 24 hours if expedited services are requested.

After getting the certificate of merger between Zendesk Charitable and Zendesk Inc, the company needs to pursue a certificate of consolidation to create a new holding company. When all the documents are prepared, they are sent to the company through snail mail.

If you are checking the site for real time updates, clicking on the link of a consolidated company will likely cause you to be redirected to the original search page.

If you click on any one of the corporations and the unofficial certificate of good standing fails to load, the company's status has also been changed to consolidation. A potential merger arbitrage will be available since return mail does take at least 1 day.",0.86,5,0,5,question,2022-11-04T23:55:35Z,ymbn97,t3

One of the biggest intraday dumps and recoveries I have seen in a long time and also one of the first times ive seen it with the VIX at such a low level. 

Next week we have election midterms and we have CPI. I will this weekend or next week sometimes post my CPI trade plan to the server but for now here is my expectations for CPI next week after running the numbers. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/elizrxa930y91.png?width=484&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=523d615fe4c4afde022a1f70471e1cc3a5b4bae9

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/z3snoeo930y91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9017c5f75bba431e2e87901486bfadaa448c65b

Lets take a little more of a zoomed out look on the daily this time. What do we see? We see that we are still well within that green bear channel of 2022 and are holding right around that red dotted 50% retracement line. We have also formed over the last 2 months now a very sizeable black rising wedge that support was actually reconfirmed on today. We also held the red channel support of 370.6 extremely well today and rejected the 378 channel resistance all in one single day (which is impressive). Effectively we are stuck in this train and rising wedge until otherwise proven. 

Bull case for next week- bulls want to see a midterm election week rally and see a rally into CPI. First step is taking out that 378 resistance and establishing that as support. From there its time to take the red resistance line out from FOMC and look to retest the daily 100ema resistance around 388-390. 

Bear case for next week- with a looming CPI ahead and the FOMC pivot on the pivot this week bears will look to continue to reject 378 channel resistance and eventually break through and close under the 370.5 support and break the support of the black rising wedge. Once that is broken bears have opened the downside to re-test the 350 to 360 support area. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2bfkkd5a30y91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e512c7c006be622548dd43c6fd3a4df6d5346c99

On the weekly timeframe you can see we actually did break the rising wedge that is present from last week. However, we did come down and retest the weekly 200ema and confirmed that as support this week. With this candle body closing inside of last weeks bears and bulls both have an opportunity to break out next week and this could be the start of a bull flag if the bulls can defend 375.9 next week. 

Key support- 375.9 -&gt; 363.6 -&gt; 357

Key resistance- 390.2 -&gt; 408.6

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2jv8guqa30y91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b0221f5520ba291ee83d3caff612c9865da3810

Futures has a similar rising wedge formed with the downside resistance from FOMC. Overall a really nice double bottom and bullishly engulfing candle on futes daily that should provide some upside for Monday next week. Bulls need to retake that 3805 resistance next week early and bears will look to take out 3710 support early next week. Both of these remain key pivot points for futures. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/eufo1b8b30y91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5a7796d72bee08c5cf9213acc44204d9a54b92e

Futures (SPY too really) has a overall macro falling wedge with a blue bull channel that has a blue/ red rising wedge inside of it… yay TA! Overall this was a double top on the weekly at 3910, however, this could easily form into a 3775 double bottom come Sunday night at open and easily lead to an upside push next week. With the weekly 200ema being held once again we should look at upside not downside. 

Key support- 3775 -&gt; 3705 -&gt; 3590

Key resistance- 3910 -&gt; 4085

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gc2wolqb30y91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=60a77eadeef4c232598cc943d91664050aeb060d

Apple had one of the most interesting intradays I have seen on a non major catalysts day in a long time. Apple went all the day down to the October CPI LOD within one penny and someone still managed to rally back and close over 138.2. I actually REALLY would have liked to take apple calls with this closure back over key 138.2 support but it was EOD and too late plus I already had TESLA calls im swinging and SPY I opened instead. 

Apple will look to attempt to gap fill that 145 gap for the bulls and bears are going to attempt to close under 138.2 and put in a new 52 week low. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i9ifx6bc30y91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0cb54a497a1a26685abc6a65cae03b3bf8c0f2b6

The weekly show just how strong this 138.2 support is for Apple and why I was so ready to pull the trigger on calls but was too slow. You can also see that Apple did close back under its weekly 100ema and put In its biggest red week since March 2020 during the COVID crash. 

Key support – 138.2 -&gt; 133.3 -&gt; 129.1

Key resistance- 141.2 -&gt; 147.1 -&gt; 150.8

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5zuvm9uc30y91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b43a51e50533e8fc418a07d6c2c691cb3f289590

Tesla as I had mentioned continues to range in that 205.6 to 234 red channel. I had played some overnight calls on tesla for a huge 47.8% win at open on a 7dte and thankfully closed at open because wow did it get absolutely smacked down. Tesla put in a $20.72 drop from HOD to LOD which was 156% of its average 10day range. A pretty impressive range for Tesla that’s for sure. The biggest thing we have forming here on Tesla is that huge blue/ black diamond and we bounced hard one again off the 205.6 support range. I will be looking for an upside move next week on Tesla and remain bullish especially as long as we continue to hold 205.6 support. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/iztfevdd30y91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3775a029fe4ebe54c829bb59a9c5508c917f74b1

AS you can see on Tesla weekly chart we are still within that downward bear channel and did reject an attempt to breakout over the weekly 8ema. There is also a breakout triangle forming with key level of 224.2 and 207.8 for next week. 

Key supports- 204.4 -&gt; 192.1

Key resistance- 228.3 -&gt; 245

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/157xkwhe30y91.png?width=610&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad41f6767f0490a95c28e16704e60fc6bbd4cee0

We finally saw some volatility with the VIX today with a pretty large rebound spike when we had that huge 1115am dump. However, the vix remains in the downward channel and realistically until we see that resistance broken and see a major major bearish catalyst (cough CPI cough) I wouldn’t be shorting just yet. You COULD start adding slow longer DTE puts like 30-60 dte but I feel you are still early and are just wasting money. WE are also approaching that key 23.6 VIX support area and funny enough before the September CPI we actually were right at the 23.6 support area too. Perhaps we see a pretty bullish three days next week on the markets much like September leading into CPI and then CPI starts the next leg down headed into December. 

Overall I lean for a bullish Monday at least with a possible choppy Tuesday/ Wednesday as markets prepare for CPI but there is a very good chance we could see a pretty impressive green week next week and end up all the back up near 390 before CPI hits. The higher we are the bigger drop I believe CPI could potentially bring for us. 

Daily log- 

This was another amazing week for me. The week really did suck Monday and Tuesday and then after taking that bigger L on Wednesday I was able to recover today and end up finishing the week off going 11 for 11 today with 4 for 4 on scalps and 7 for 7 on level to level plays. Note- a lot of people are inquiring more about my level to level plays so this is something I will once again try to cover and I will make a post this weekend about it I hope. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jshjt4ze30y91.png?width=888&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fccc1c3e198a4ab59265a8fb834330bfc48e8ecd

Interestingly enough… this is now the 2nd week in a row where my level to level plays have netted a greater profit then my actual scalps. This is something I will continue to monitor as time goes forward and I will continue to adjust as time goes on. This week was also extremely tough to scalp as Monday and Tuesday were very untradeable and then Wednesday with the IV spiking was tougher to trade too for big gains. However, with this being the 2nd week in a row with these results I will continue to monitor and see going forward if this trend holds. But for anyone following me who struggles to get in on the scalps while obviously the win rate is no perfect on the L2L plays and never will be with the built in price target stop loss and take profit target (tho I regrettably always take profits early) the profits should greatly outweigh the losses. Definitely something to keep in mind going forward for me. 

Youtube will be up later!

I’m new to wsb, I discussed my stocks more with friends but they all gave up on trading lol. I made big profits in the last years with Tesla and other tech stuff (about 500%). I was basically a buy and hold investor but started with options some months ago to leverage my portfolio. It did well but I’m less optimistic now. I think the next years will be though and shorting the Nasdaq 100 is still a good move now. But I’ll still hold Tesla and Apple. Maybe some other large caps too - It’s hard to let them go after all those years of profits.

The only thing I’m really optimistic right now is Porsche. It startet only about one month ago and the Porsche family is happily buying back as much stocks as possible. They set a very low price on the stock to buy it back very cheap. I think they secretly want to buy back everything to own it again like in the early 2000s. I’m not sure if they are genius or crazy… Anyway I also calculated a target price of 154€ per share in the short term and expect it much higher if they really want to buy it back. The fundamentals and future are amazing and I bought lots of lots of calls. Maybe some of you have also looked at P911 and wants to discuss it.

8,wallstreetbets,caprazzi,self.wallstreetbets,6,Paramount (PARA) - The Cheapest Stock in the Market,"Just coming on to share the mind-bogglingly low valuation of Paramount (PARA). Consider the following:

1.) Paramount possesses the fastest growing streaming offering in the market, Paramount+.

2.) Paramount owns CBS and has the rights to broadcast most NFL games as well as Premier League Soccer.

3.) Paramount Pictures has had a wildly successful year, including the release of Top Gun Maverick, the 5th highest grossing film of all time. 

Despite this, PARA shares are trading at an embarrassingly low valuation:

1.) Price/earnings multiple of less than 8.

2.) Approximately one third price/sales.

3.) Less than half of book value.

Paramount is definitely a company in transition, but this valuation dislocation is borderline criminal. On top of this beautiful stock sundae, you get more than 6% in dividend yield just to hold the shares while you wait for the price to normalize, and the short interest is just under 15%.

23,wallstreetbets,ThreeD710,self.wallstreetbets,2,Effects of Inflationary Boom/Bust or Deflationary Boom/Bust on the businesses involved in Energy,"This is a abridged post and is a summary of the following four scenarios –

1. **Inflationary Boom** – increase in prices along with an increase in economic growth
2. **Inflationary Bust or Stagflation** – increase in prices along with a decrease in economic growth
3. **Deflationary Boom** – decrease in prices along with an increase in economic growth
4. **Deflationary Bust** – decrease in prices along with a decrease in economic growth

And how they affect –

1. **Demand for energy**
2. **Investments in energy**

These scenarios occur in varying frequency and sequence over short periods (about 5 years) of time, which combine to form a regime. A regime can either be inflationary (increasing prices) or deflationary (decreasing prices) and can last several decades. The last four decades have been deflationary, and the next four, **appear inflationary**.

**Why do the four scenarios matter**\*\*?\*\*

Because the change in prices and economic growth affect the rate of inflation, which in turn affects the interest rate, which affects how much money is in the economy. The amount of money in the economy affects commercial and retail borrowing and spending, leading to an increase/decrease in demand for goods and services. **An increase/decrease in the demand for goods and services leads to an increase/decrease in the demand for energy**.

&amp;#x200B;

**How can inflation and economic growth be tracked**\*\*?\*\* (A few examples)

1. **Headline CPI** – measures the rate of change of inflation on a monthly, quarterly, and annual basis
2. **Rent Inflation** – comprises 32% of the headline CPI
3. **Services Inflation** – comprises 57% of the headline CPI
4. **Import Prices** – rate of change in the prices of goods and services purchased from foreign sellers
5. **Producer Price Index** \- measures price change for commodities sold for personal consumption, capital investment, government, and export
6. **Chicago Fed National Activity Index** \- is designed to gauge overall economic activity and related inflationary pressure
7. **Capacity Utilization** \- used to measure the rate at which potential output levels are being met or used

**Why are we heading to a regime change which will be inflationary**\*\*?\*\*

**Let us begin by quickly summarizing the disinflationary drivers of the last 40 years** –

1. **China** – the country managed to bring over 600 million people into the workforce and out of poverty. This helped improve their lives but also provided cheap labor to the global economy. At the same time, China laid the massive manufacturing and logistics infrastructure which has made it the manufacturing powerhouse that it is today
2. **Collapse of USSR** – led to the migration of cheap labor from Eastern Europe to Mainland Europe
3. **Outsourcing** – exasperated with high inflation from the mid 1960’s to the mid 1980’s, developed economies willingly accepted the idea to outsource or offshore their manufacturing to China
4. **Immigration** – the same reason stated in point 3 led to developed economies opening up to immigration from developing economies which led to wages being driven down
5. **Debt** – Increase in debt (through monetary policy) led to businesses running on the loss-making model as well as increased competition
6. **Technology** – the ultimate disinflationary driver which made the World smaller, expedited exchange and execution of ideas, gaslighted innovation, and increased efficiency exponentially

**Now let us understand which of the above disinflationary drivers can slow down or turn inflationary** –

1. **China** – demography is getting older and wealthier and labor-intensive industries such as apparel and footwear are moving to Vietnam and Bangladesh. Also, it could be possible that new disinflationary drivers such as Vietnam, Bangladesh, and India can fill in the capacity of China.
2. **Outsourcing** – many developed countries have elected or are electing populist governments that promise to bring back the jobs by reshoring their industries. Also, Covid lockdowns and the Russian – Ukraine conflict has shown governments how globalized supply chains are vulnerable and de-risking supply chains to some extent by localizing them would be a strategic necessity.
3. **Immigration** – again, many developed countries have elected or are electing governments that promise or have a mandate in place that caps immigration which would cut off access to foreign cheap labor and talent.
4. **Debt** – many developed countries are running debt to GDP ratios in excess of 100% and any increase in debt through monetary policy would be a very unpopular opinion among the population

**And the new drivers of the Inflationary Regime?**

1. **ESG** – The transition to Net Zero involves a large negative supply shock and mega capex
2. **Inequality** – the disinflationary regime of the last 40 years worked in favor of the capitalists against the labor, and the monetary policies in place since 2008 exacerbated this inequality. The current inflationary period will put pressure on governments to work on closing the gap in inequality, which will further increase pressures on inflation
3. **Fiscal Policy** – governments are already putting money in the hands of the people so that they can weather the inflation or are providing subsidies. Fiscal policy is proven to be inflationary.

&amp;#x200B;

**As this is an abridged version, I have briefly listed the reasons for my base case of an inflationary regime. I believe that we are currently in a stagflation environment and may either remain in a stagflation environment for a while or alternate between an inflationary boom and stagflation.**

**Having said that, I would like to briefly mention a few of my thoughts or rather, my musings. Will post these musings in a Part 2 Post as this post is already long.**

**Will update this post with the link to Part 2 when I post it.**",0.77,5,0,5,dd,2022-11-04T19:58:07Z,ym5osp,t3

That's why I always wanted to have a lot of money, not to spend on myself, but to give dignity and meet basic needs to my family.

That's when I realized that I should know the rules of the financial market, to play the money game.

I realized that there are a lot of unfair things, such as: The bank would lend me 125x an amount to invest in a stock, but they wouldn't lend me the same amount to finance a house.

* Apple's market value is now higher than that of Alphabet, Amazon and Meta combined.
* The iPhone maker's worth stands at $2.307 trillion, while its tech peers add up to $2.306 trillion.
* Tech stocks have suffered after posting poor quarterly earnings, but Apple dodged a wipeout.

Apple is now worth more than fellow tech giants Alphabet, Amazon and Meta combined, after it ended trading Wednesday with a market value of $2.307 trillion.

At the same time, the market caps of its three tech giant peers added up to $2.306 trillion at the close of trading Wednesday. Google parent Alphabet's market cap stood at $1.126 trillion, Amazon's at $939.78 billion and Facebook parent Meta's at $240.07 billion, Yahoo Finance data showed.

Overall, Big Tech stocks suffered a brutal selloff last week on the back of disappointing quarterly earnings. But Apple's stock has outperformed its peers after it beat Wall Street's revenue and profit forecasts for its fourth quarter.

The iPhone maker's shares soared 8% in the wake of its results. After their earnings reports, Meta plunged more than 20%, Amazon fell about 10%, while Alphabet saw a single-digit decline.

Alphabet, Amazon and Meta's lackluster earnings signaled that demand for digital advertising is flagging. The poorly-received results have helped wipe billions off their market values as their shares fell, and pushed Amazon out of the trillion-dollar market cap club.

Over the past five sessions, Apple's stock has risen 0.16%, while Alphabet has fallen 5.7%, Amazon is down 17.0% and Meta has lost 7.6% over that period.

Despite Apple's achievement, its market cap has fallen back from its $2.193 trillion value at the end of 2021. A series of headwinds — high inflation, rising interest rates, fears of recession and the Ukraine war among them — have meant tech stocks have struggled in 2022 as investors lost appetite for higher risk assets.

Florida-headquartered hedge fund Elliott Management believes the global economy is in an “extremely challenging” situation which could lead to hyperinflation.

In a report on Thursday (Nov 3), the Financial Times (FT) cited a letter sent to investors (and seen by the newspaper) that “investors should not assume they have ‘seen everything’” because they have been through the peaks and troughs of the 1987 crash, the dot-com boom and the 2008 global financial crisis and previous bear and bull markets.

The British daily newspaper said the firm, led by billionaire Paul Singer and Jonathan Pollock, added that the “extraordinary” period of cheap money is coming to an end and has “made possible a set of outcomes that would be at or beyond the boundaries of the entire post-WWII period”.

The letter said the world is “on the path to hyperinflation”, which could lead to “global societal collapse and civil or international strife”.

Elliott executives estimated that markets have not fallen enough yet and equity markets could drop more than 50% would be “normal”, adding that they couldn’t predict when that would happen.

They warned clients that the idea that “‘we will not panic because we have seen this before’ does not comport with the current facts”.

They blamed central bank policymakers for the current global economic situation, saying they had been “dishonest” about the reason for high inflation.

They said lawmakers had shirked responsibility by blaming it on supply chain disruption caused by the pandemic instead of loose monetary policy imposed two years ago during the Covid-19 peak.

&gt;The FOMC’s goal is to bring inflation back down to the Committee’s 2 percent target over time, and as Wednesday’s FOMC statement and communications stressed, this will likely entail raising rates to a sufficiently restrictive level and then holding there for some time. 

&gt; A focus on the level (not the pace) is what “resolve” looks like in this second policy phase.

The pain is nowhere near done gentlemen.

We continue to articulate a different and more stringent test for the economic conditions that would need to be met before raising the federal funds rate.”

In this regard, Powell only slightly adjusted the Fed’s view on inflation from “transitory” to “expected to be transitory.”

These divisions will be: Cannabis, Branding and a 3rd to be named later (this division is being created from within). Our plan provides for each of these divisions to be generating revenue by the end of December 2023.

We estimate that we will file the Super 8-K and financial statements within days after receiving the audit for Consolidated Apparel, Inc (""Consolidated""), which is currently producing about $1.2 million in annual revenues and will remove the Company's Shell designation and add revenue to our books. Consolidated has identified several acquisition targets that complement the Consolidated operations, which if assimilated will potentially increase annual revenues. These transactions, if completed will be structured as Asset Purchases to expedite closings.

In July of 2022, the Company issued 598,800 shares of Series B Preferred for 49.9% of GCTR Management, LLC (""GCTR""), a management company in the cannabis sector in California with two clients. GCTR currently grosses revenues of approximately $300,000 per month. We have an option to purchase the remaining 50.1% percent but will look to extend that date until the end of 2023, so we can pursue other opportunities to increase our presence in the cannabis sector in California. We will continually seek new acquisitions to potentially increase our revenues and will look to lock down 49.9% of two other entities with options to acquire the remaining portion by the end of 2023.

We have agreed to work on new projects with our partners in California with each side owning 50%.

Our new division is being set up from within services of a sector our management has decades of experience in, which we are planning to roll out during the 4th quarter of 2022.

Additionally, in the 4th quarter, we plan to begin setting up operations in the Caribbean to expand both our Branding and Cannabis divisions. For our Branding division, we plan to manufacture products on the island to be sold on the island and export products back to the United States. For Cannabis, we plan to acquire the real estate and equipment needed to operate a manufacturing operation. We will not be involved in the day-to-day operations, but plan to receive a monthly fee for the building and use of the equipment equal to 25% of the monthly revenue.

The Company, in compliance with SEC regulations, will use social media outlets like Facebook or Twitter and its own website at [www.igpk.org](http://www.igpk.org/) to announce key information in compliance with Regulation FD.

A new report delivered to Maryland lawmakers this week shows the national market for legal cannabis growing to $72 billion per year by 2030.

A $75 Billion Industry

The report, which was prepared and presented to the work group by Mathew Swinburne, associate director of Network for Public Health Law-Eastern Region of Baltimore, includes information from New Frontier Data that projects steady growth of the nationwide market as current markets mature and new states are added to the roster of legal cannabis states. Growing from $32 billion in 2022, the projection estimates a total market nationwide of $72 billion by 2030. 

“We know that the cannabis industry is a profitable industry,” said Swinburne. “This is a new industry that is filled with economic opportunity and that opportunity is only growing,” he added. “Although this industry presents some significant economic opportunities, communities of color are missing out on this cannabis boom.”

Swinburne told the work group that jobs in the cannabis industry rose from about 321,000 in 2020 to approximately 428,000 a year later. However, the report also notes that 81% of cannabis businesses are owned by white people and 58% of businesses have no employees who are members of minority groups. 

Main benefactors of this growth remain TRULIEVE, VERANO, GREENTHUMB, CURALEAF, CRESCO Labs 

The five largest MSOS - and most profitable - currently operating in USA.

Hip-hop mogul and entrepreneur is acquiring marijuana assets to be divested in merger of Cresco Labs and Columbia Care

Sean “Diddy” Combs has agreed to purchase licensed marijuana operations in three states for up to $185 million, adding a new business to a portfolio that includes fashion, media and spirits.

If approved by U.S. and state regulators, the deal could create the nation’s largest Black-owned and licensed cannabis company. Mr. Combs said he wants to use the business as a platform to increase Black participation in the cannabis industry.

He said he decided to enter the market to help address long-running inequities. Black people have been disproportionately arrested for marijuana crimes, research has shown. They also comprise a tiny percentage of those making money from the legal cannabis market. In the 26 years since California first legalized medical marijuana, cannabis has grown into a $27 billion legal business in the U.S. and is projected to reach $42 billion in annual U.S. sales by 2026, according to data service BDSA.

The recipients of the proceeds - cresco labs and columbia care who are merging - are one of the top five components of MSOS ETF - which includes TRULIEVE, VERANO, CURALEAF, and GREENTHUMB

This quarter’s unprecedented profitability growth is solid proof that our company’s strategy is paying off.

As a result of having acquired six vessels in the course of ten months, we generated net income of $15.5 million in a single quarter which is 15,400% higher than our profit in Q2 22’ and equivalent to 23% of our current market capitalization; We incurred moderate debt during the quarter, maintaining a healthy capital structure with $42.3 million of debt while preserving a free cash balance available for further fleet expansion of about $92 million. Given the strong market fundamentals and the promising charter rate environment and by taking advantage of our efficient management of our expanded fleet, we believe that we will achieve strong results and generate significant cash flow going forward.

I spend money on almost nothing else but options/gambling. I've put around 20k into other business ventures like game development or e-commerce but I've lost all of that as well because of course those ventures led no-where.

62,wallstreetbets,c0diiii,self.wallstreetbets,8,The Hindenburg Omen - A Indicator Present When Market Conditions Are Ripe For A Crash,"\*\*\*For those of you interested in technical analysis, this post is for you. Before you read the long post, there is a link with a video that is more up to date on market conditions and shows the indicators in action. I thought this was a good topic for a discussion due to current market conditions.\*\*\*

**The Hindenburg Omen** \- A rare market signal with a foreboding name is telling traders to prepare for a possible significant decline. Invoking the memory of the flaming explosion of LZ 129 Hindenburg in 1937. The stock market “Hindenburg Omen” signal plays on images of a monumental disaster.

It is easy to see why many of such observations preceded the **35%** drop in the **S&amp;P 500** in early 2020 – certainly a stock market disaster by any measure. However, when these signals are present, it may be good practice to form an exit strategy and help mitigate any potential losses. Let’s dig into what this indicator is and why its signals are important warnings for precarious market circumstances. 

What is the Hindenburg Omen?

The Hindenburg Omen is a term used in stock trading where certain market conditions align to form a signal. For instance, it’s a warning that conditions are ripe for a steep market decline. 

What are the market conditions to incite this tumble? Look for the following four conditions all occurring on the same day:

* The number of new **NYSE** 52-week highs is greater than **2.8%** of all unchanged issues.
* The number of new **NYSE** 52-week lows is greater than **2.8%** of all unchanged issues.
* The number of new 52-week highs is not more than double the number of new 52-week lows.
* The **NYSE** Composite Index 50-day moving average is rising.

**These first two conditions are the important ones.**

Having a significant number of stocks making new 52-week highs at the same time. While a significant number are making new 52-week lows, signals an unhealthy market. When markets are well-behaved, most stocks tend to move together. When they do not, we should be warned and either readjust or improve our trading discipline. 

\*\*\***That warning puts us on notice that for the subsequent 30 days after any observation, there is a greater than normal chance of a crash on any one of those days where the McClellan oscillator is less than zero.\*\*\***

A Hindenburg Omen in 2022

Market observers saw some signals of another Hindenburg Omen as the markets started to decline in January of 2022. Whether this induces another crash remains to be seen. But it highlights why it is important to keep an eye out for indicators suggesting a crash. Especially in unpredictable markets. They are infrequent, but when they occur, it can give us an early warning to watch for signs that might corroborate a decline.

In late 2021 and again in early 2022, we saw a cluster of Hindenburg Omen observations, as recently as January 14th. That has put us on warning to look for exactly the kind of selling which we have already observed and the potential for even more. On any day when the McClellan oscillator is below zero, down moves could turn ugly.  

This warning sign will remain for a 30-day period from the last observation. When significant selling follows the omen and then turns the 50-day moving average of the **NYSE** composite index down, as it has in early 2022. There cannot be another, fresh Hindenburg observation until the moving average turns back up. Bear markets often begin with attempts to regain a new high which fail. Often this action can set up fresh Hindenburg Omen signals for a subsequent leg down. If markets do bounce, it will be something to watch for.

There are some who say that the Hindenburg, filled with hydrogen, was destined for disaster.  However, the airship traveled ten times from Germany to the United States without incident before the crossing where it burst into flames, and **36%** of those aboard perished.

**Likewise, not every observation of the Omen ends in a stock market disaster. It is, however, a sign of a dangerous condition.**

I found a supporting video that discusses this signal in detail with examples of charts and how you can set it up on our trading platform.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%. (Stats as of 2022-10-28)",0.7,5,0,5,dd,2022-11-04T02:32:00Z,yljvwz,t3

73,wallstreetbets,Able_Excuse_4456,self.wallstreetbets,14,Learn from my mistakes! (Selling Puts),"Not looking for advice here, just sharing some lessons that others may benefit.

I've been using equity Options for a couple years to boost yield. Not Robinhood, not even based on WSB, but legitimate income boosting from my own individual research. It started with simple covered Calls, and then I made a few quick bucks with cash-covered Puts. It was some of the easiest money I ever made.

Jim Cramer says that pigs get slaughtered. Unfortunately, I started getting piggish. Jim does have his moments from time to time.

I got a little looser with my Puts, by not having cash to cover in my brokerage account. I have the cash, but it's in Savings. I started making riskier Puts because they had nice premiums. Had to roll a few, even took a few debits, but was overall positive in taking free cash in exchange for a little risk.

My usual tactic was to watch for a symbol to lose 10-20% in a day, wait a day to stabilize, and then sell a Put for another 20% discount. And I'd get 5% annualized yield. They almost always expire harmlessly OTM. Money for nothing. Easy, right?

Some dipped too close for comfort, or even went ITM. No problem, I can roll. Once or twice, I had to open a new nearly-naked Put position to buy out or roll another one. Like paying off a credit card with another credit card. Financial coaches always recommend that kind of behavior, right?

Well, this week, I had 3 of these riskier semi-naked Put positions hit a trifecta. Bad press, bad earnings call, and the Fed Meeting. All 3 plunged 50-80% in days. Far below the Strike. Of the 3, there is really only 1 that I wouldn't mind owning.

Rolling will cost me almost all my gains from the last year, most of which are already invested into other shares that are covering a Call position. So I'll probably have to infuse more cash to buy back or roll at least 2 just to prevent a forced assignment 50% above the share price. Income accounts are meant to withdraw from, not dump more into just to avoid losing even more cash.

Please learn these lessons:

1. Don't sell a Put on a company that you don't want to own.
2. Have the cash in your brokerage to cover it.
3. Don't transact right before Earnings season when it's already a volatile stock.
4. Low volume Options are harder to roll your way out of.
5. Limit your Puts to 1-2 at any given time.
6. Don't be greedy.

Fortunately for me, these are all low dollar mistakes. I set a personal cap at $25 share price to sell a Put, and that saved my hide. Had this happened with high flyers like Meta, I'd be hosed.

Hear me out. FuboTV is reporting earnings tomorrow morning. There's been an uptick on Google searches for Fubo in the past 3 months alongside increased searches in related topics of sports TV subscriptions:

* [https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=%2Fg%2F11c60pfzx6&amp;geo=US](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=%2Fg%2F11c60pfzx6&amp;geo=US)

Compare this to Roku, which did not experience this search uptick. Roku also spent a lot of capital on physical Roku TVs, which the markets punished after its earnings yesterday. Fubo is unburdened by these types of capital expenditures.

* [https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=%2Fm%2F0\_x7l9\_](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=%2Fm%2F0_x7l9_)

Currently, **short interest in FUBO is 24.95%**. With Fubo trading at all time lows, Fubo just has to not report terrible earnings and awful future projections (subscriptions by sports fans are quite resilient to recessions because it's an ""affordable luxury"") for the stock to rally. This domino can lead to a squeeze.

\*I don't care for their policies but I do still keep FB because of family and friends, easiest way to find someone, I also Use IG a lot more lately, and whatsapp.

\* I don't care for Z's meta dream currently but I like the cash generating machine and I like todays 2015 valuation. Here is my thesis for long $META.

META dropped -38% in the last 8 days! Which is a +60% upside to OCT 27th prices. I have a feeling funds will be averaging down soon. See charts below.

https://preview.redd.it/wrzy8aklftx91.png?width=1396&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39bfeff5b048823067907033f7fc049ca2535e23

&amp;#x200B;

[META is projected to grow  to record rev in 2023 to 2025 still and just needs to cut spending. ](https://preview.redd.it/yf06wq8patx91.png?width=2110&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01a967cbf7c19800ac2970d23463433cae9e6796)

First of lets talk about why META is down. Obviously when other tech stocks, some of the biggest in the world can drop -20% overnight like AMZN recently did, NFLX -39% overnight it shows we are in one of the most volatile markets ever. Never have we seen such giant market caps drop this much. So this for 1 presents a big opportunity for me.

:Note NFLX has recovered from that -39% overnight drop and is still up 65% since even with the big drop this past week. It recovered 88% in around 4 months time even with the NASDAQ falling -30% since its drop.

https://preview.redd.it/871e3q18ctx91.png?width=1371&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e12efa6bbc5b3e13656784111d463108b1784ec

&amp;#x200B;

The main reason META is down is because of their spending, but many think Meta is spending only on the METAVERSE which is not the case. Their big spending is for the following which will generate record future cash flow with their current ad rev strategy on new platforms.

**Reasons for future Rev growth even in a recession.**

1)Instagram reels fully monetized

2)Whatsapp &amp; Messenger monetization

3) New AI Discovery Engine to make ad targeting more effective with higher average revenue per user.

4) 2.93+ Billion family users fully monetized.

5)An economic downturn recovery &amp; or more spending for ads again.

**Revenue declined slightly because of the following &amp; can rebound quick**

IMO it is Cyclical as number of users are increasing and user time is rising.

1. U.S. Dollar was beating other currencies and Meta gets a lot of ad rev in international markets.
2. A lot of ads from finance have slowed, the highest paying ads, once we sees a rise in market sentiment those ads come back.

3)Instagram and facebook  reels are not being monetized YET which gets 140 BILLION reels played DAILY!, neither is Messenger and Whatsapp.

4)Apples 2021 Privacy changes, Note The New AI discovery engine will fix this for Meta.

5) Mark and management have started record spending currently on infrastructure /AI discovery engine which is what they are spending the most.

6) 2022 expenses $85-87 2023 projected $96 to $101 billion, which Meta can still be cash flow positive but Mark should and could revamp some spending and do this over 2 years vs 1 and the stock could see a massive move up as funds come back.

7) Many funds have far higher averages and IMO could start averaging up.

These funds below have added before the big drop! Algos have likely been selling as well.

[META is still top 100 revenue generating companies in the entire world ranked at 65 for rev, and 19 out of 7126 for Earnings STILL.](https://preview.redd.it/qbtgcdfdhtx91.png?width=1293&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=863a7752f43c17aea1b9b7d5a40ba6122dc50e3e)

If the meteverse works out this company is projected to 10x to 25x from todays valuations. 236 Billion and could bring in more revenue than the major stocks with massive overheads AMZN WMT etc with META having little overhead.

 Meta has a family of 3 billion users and growing. Starlink from Elon is  helping third world countries get internet and those are new people to  social media. I have a friend a brazilian actress that visited an amazon  tribe and they are using FB and Instagram and especially whatsapp now  on smart phones. Seriously! Billions of more users open up to social  media as Starlink progresses. People only think in their own bubble and  forget there are billions of people that love metas products. 

TLDR: If meta comes out with a revised spending plan the stock could gap up overnight, They could stretch spending over 2 years vs 1. Even if Metaverse does not work out it can easily 3x from here as spending is for AI ad growth with new infrastructure. Funds Should start to average down soon.

Hope you enjoyed this DD. I like buying Undervalued stocks I got in GME at $4.50 and posted here about it. Not saying Meta is going to go up but I am using profits this year to YOLO it.

# Hedge fund Elliott warns of more pain to come after 2022 market rout

Prominent asset manager says ‘hyperinflation’ could spark one of the worst crises since the second world war

The world is on the road to “hyperinflation” and could be heading towards its worst financial crisis since the second world war, according to Elliott Management, one of the world’s biggest and most influential hedge funds.

The Florida-based firm, which was founded by billionaire Paul Singer and manages about $56bn in assets, has warned its clients of an “extremely challenging” situation for the global economy and for financial markets where investors will find it difficult to make money.

An “extraordinary” set of financial extremes that come as the era of cheap money draws to a close “have made possible a set of outcomes that would be at or beyond the boundaries of the entire post-WWII period,” it wrote in the letter, which was seen by the Financial Times.

“Investors should not assume they have ‘seen everything’” just because they have experienced financial crises such as the 1970s bear market and oil price shock, the 1987 market crash, the dotcom bust or the 2008 financial crisis, it added.

Elliott declined to comment.

The group’s warning comes during a dismal year for markets, in which global equities have shed $28tn in value, according to Bloomberg data, and bonds have also tumbled, leaving investors with few places to seek shelter.

The fund manager laid much of the blame for the looming crisis on central bank policymakers, which it said had been “dishonest” about the causes of high inflation by blaming it on supply chain bottlenecks in the wake of the pandemic, rather than on ultra-loose monetary policy put in place at the height of the coronavirus crisis in 2020.

The world is “on the path to hyperinflation”, it said, which could lead to “global societal collapse and civil or international strife”. While such an outcome is not certain, this is currently the direction that the world was headed, it added.

Its warnings come as investors try to assess the economic damage likely to be felt from a rapid series of large interest rate increases in the US and elsewhere, as central bankers race to try to curb soaring inflation.

The S&amp;P has dropped 20 per cent since its peak at the start of this year, while the Nasdaq is down by one-third since its high a year ago.

However, Elliott said markets had not fallen far enough, given the many risks present, and warned of a further reversal of the so-called ‘everything rally’ seen near the top of the bull market of recent years, as sky-high investor exuberance lifted all manner of risky assets.

There are so many “frightening and seriously negative possibilities” that it is hard not to think that “a seriously adverse unwind of the everything bubble” is coming, it said.

The hedge fund estimates a 50 per cent fall from peak to trough would be “normal”, suggesting further large falls to come in major equity markets, although it added it was impossible to know whether or when that would happen.

Elliott, which is up 6.4 per cent in 2022 and which has only lost money in two calendar years since launch in 1977, pointed to a handful of areas of potential stress that could accelerate market falls. It highlighted banks’ losses on bridge financing, potential markdowns of collateralised loan obligations and leveraged private equity as areas of potential risk for markets.

The firm was also critical of investors who believed market falls will always prove shortlived and can be “ignored”.

The idea that “‘we will not panic because we have seen this before’ does not comport with the current facts”, it said.",0.76,54,0,54,chart,2022-11-04T00:53:12Z,ylhggj,t3

11,wallstreetbets,Kelanfarx,self.wallstreetbets,212,ASTS - An Investment and A Trade (I),"# 1/ ASTS - An Investment and A Trade

If you are a non-virgin, you understand that the sole purpose for investing and trading is to generate returns, to increase the NAV of your brokerage account and to push your net worth in the upward direction. Why? Because it feels good to have the monetary freedom to do whatever the fuck you want, because green GAIN porn is better than red loss porn, and because it is better to look at your account balance and smile instead of twitch in misery. You are here to make money. You are not here to “be right,” — you are here to generate returns, and preferably, returns in excess of the market, in so much excess of the SPY that you are catapulted towards massive capital appreciation (meaningful tendies) before age 80.

The challenge obviously is that it’s extremely fucking difficult to extract money from the markets, especially with an appropriate level of risk. Unless you are a boomer investing with a 50 year horizon, the markets are designed to fuck you over. Markets are difficult and good opportunities are scarce, especially in a bear market environment like we’ve seen YTD. But remember Warren Buffet said “be something when others are something”? Yes, and today is your opportunity.

Right now, an asymmetrical risk-reward investment window is present in ASTS, a company called AST SpaceMobile, where (i) the disruptive technology and scalable commercialization plan are set to create immense value in the coming months, years and decades, (ii) the macro environment allows for a chance to get in *early* into a potential “millionaire maker” name like NVDA or TSLA, and (iii) a contrarian and concentrated bet can provide incredible upside with manageable level of risk.

I am going to spare you impatient people who are already desperately looking for a TLDR from the “generational opportunity” technical thesis but instead show you the swing TRADE SETUP in ASTS that in my mind has a chance of printing money in the next few weeks and months. Three factors: (1) three meaningful catalysts in mid November, (2) continued business plan execution updates, (3) forces from market participants, potentially with better macro tailwinds, could make the ASTS stock spike, consolidate and push upward in a staircase pattern to high levels. Read on.

# 2/ The Background and the Backers

Notwithstanding the fact that Cathie Wood is washed up, disruptive technology wins in the long-term. Not Roku or Zoom but TRUE innovation that propels humankind forward. ASTS pushes forward that kind of technology, aiming to become the first comprehensive space-based cellular service provider, bridging the connectivity gap across the globe by providing high speed internet access to billions of unconnected people, and powering billions of others who move in and out of coverage even in developed markets like the US.

ASTS is launching a network of satellites to provide these services to any mobile device on the planet. That is achieved through deploying and operating satellite “cell towers” in orbit that will cover the entire Earth with 4G / 5G / LTE signal. The technology links directly to any unmodified smartphone, and unlike Starlink, doesn’t require any additional hardware. This monumental step forward in global connectivity is done through launching proprietary 168 BlueBird satellites into orbit and beaming signal through ASTS patented technology.

All sounds dreamy but this achievement means little for ASTS stock without a solid plan for commercialization. ASTS monetizes the technology through B2B revenue sharing agreements with existing global MNOs like AT&amp;T or Vodafone, who already back the company and even have repeated investments in ASTS. These profit sharing mechanisms effectively remove any customer acquisition or CRM costs for ASTS, and open the opportunity for fat free cash flow margins (Transhumanica thinks 90%+ EBITDA margins) after the network is operational.

Right now, ASTS is on path for business plan execution with one of the main hurdles, having the first BlueWalker 3 satellite in space, already complete in September. The BlueWalker 3 is now orbiting Earth at 17,000 mph and is ready to start “unfurling” on November 10th with testing shortly thereafter.

[BlueWalker 3 satellite and the ASTS team](https://preview.redd.it/33cpnveensx91.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7059c581f68dd7f8adb8bb5663bea60f99ba61e1)

The TEAM: Abel Avellan, Rakuten, Invesat, Vodafone, AMERICAN TOWER corporation.

The guy in charge, the CEO is Abel Avellan. A chad who was founder of another satellite-based communications company EMC that he sold for $550M in July 2016, using proceeds for initial funding of ASTS. He is executing on the business plan with skin in the game with 78M shares (\~$500M currently) and majority of his networth tied in ASTS shares.

Other direct backers that have stakes include **Rakuten, Invesat, Vodafone and American Tower Corporation**. On top of that ASTS has partnerships and conversations with multiple MNOs in different jurisdictions to provide their service through the B2B revenue sharing model once satellites are operational. Quick cap table. Total shares outstanding 183.0M from 10Q as of August 5, 2022.

* BRiley equity research has outstanding $15 PT.
* DB equity research has outstanding $30 PT.
* Barclays equity research has outstanding $15 PT.
* Also people on the ASTS subreddit have provided incredibly detailed research on the technology and the company.

The NON-BELIEVERS:

* Kerrisdale Capital released some bearish seller research if you’re interested in reading a negative scenario case.

# 3/ The Astrology and the Price

As a former SPAC, ASTS first got attention in late 2020 and participated in the high-growth mania of that period, reaching a peak price of over $25 in February 2021. To me, that price action is of little significance as it was fueled by an incredible frenzy in overall markets, which soon deflated and normalized later in the year. The company de-SPACed in April 2021. Since then, ASTS displayed remarkable resilience despite being a high-growth, unprofitable company in a very punishing macro environment, where rising interest rates have caused the valuation DCF discount rates to go up, valuation multiples to go down, acutely hurting stocks that have more expected FCF value in the future.

The market is a mystery and it can price something far from true value for a long time. It’s hard to value ASTS as most cash flow is in the future. To me, if execution is good, I’d just do $5B EBITDA in 2026 and 8x multiple, discounted to today at 20% – we’d see $100+ per share valuation. Of course it’s a bit binary so we have to be aware of the downside risks with execution at zero. Nevertheless the equity research people are bullish including Deutsche Bank, Barclays, BRiley.

Deutsche Bank note from August when ASTS spiked on BlueWalker news:

[Deutsche Bank comment](https://preview.redd.it/ntirufb0osx91.png?width=992&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2800afe12df4affb7e6f9bd89f88f695ab84b4e5)

Interestingly, from June 1, 2022 to present the daily return correlation between ASTS and SPY/QQQ has been remarkably low at around 0.38, which I view as a good thing. Less dependent on daily volatility BS from indexes.

ASTS has traded in a huge channel from the lows of $5.50 to the highs of $14.00 since March 2021 to present. Previous multi-year stock “winners” they all came out of incredibly long consolidation bases which we observe here.

[ TradingView chart of ASTS, 1W ](https://preview.redd.it/dliwwerfqsx91.png?width=1813&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f0034d94a9bd64156001576681377529e74819c)

ASTS year-to-date performance as of October 26 is around -22.8%, compared to the QQQ -34.3%. For a high growth stock, it shows incredible strength — compare it with names like ARKK that are down -62.0% YTD, big dog ABNB -45.2% and SNOW -53.8%. This relative strength gives an indication that despite being currently unprofitable ASTS is likely going to be a leader going forward. Strong stocks are often future winners.

Pretty much from early July to mid-August the indexes grinded higher with QQQ up around 20% — during that time ASTS consolidated in a narrow range. After a few catalysts and good reports in early August, ASTS jumped from around $6.5 to around $14 in a matter of a few weeks. At $14 supply zone, the price action slowed and got slammed down with the overall market and sellers, pushing it down with more inflation worries and higher interest rates woes.

Now we are back at the “support” or demand area, at so-called lows where risk-to-reward becomes super attractive.

# 4/ The Dangers of a Bearish Trade and Previous Catalysts

The no-brainer trade this year was to short unprofitable technology and do nothing but watch how the overall market punishes those stocks. That was the “easy” trade on a company like ASTS that sellers capitalized on. The downward adjustment of multiples due to higher interest rates pushed DCF valuation models lower and ASTS price has been sinking. Naturally, sellers use the opportunity to profit from a structural decline where not much can be done really, the tide goes down and takes every ship down with it. BUT, this can be dangerous when a company is executing on the business plan and has positive developments.

This year we had 2 catalysts that showed what can happen when ASTS keeps executing on the business plan.

1. On March 9, 2022 the news came out that ASTS partnered with SpaceX to deliver their satellites to space. That proved ASTS is meaningfully moving forward with its objectives, and resulted in a ferocious seller covering rally that day, where just “riding with tide” as a seller backfired massively. ASTS stock almost doubled in a day: from lows of $6.20 to highs of $11.40. Later, macro pressures set in again, pushing ASTS lower and the “easy” bear trade came back in, sinking all high risk assets.
2. On July 28, 2022 yet another positive news momentum came in with BW3 satellite launch, that forced a lot of sellers to get out of the way. The frenzied rally more than doubled the stock price in a few weeks. Price went from $6.20 to $14.20, then received expected push back and yielded with broad market weakness.

After Kerrisdale released their bearish report in mid-September price nose dived and we visited the $6 “support area” and bottom of the channel. Interesting to note that previous 2 times, the stock launched from around $6.20.

I think right now there is little idiosyncratic movement to the stock, mostly macro pushing it lower, but that is about to change. Now is an optimal time to get in because we are the bottom of the channel and 3 massive catalysts are upcoming next week, hopefully aided by the tailwinds from macro (not guaranteed) and pressures from sellers relenting as company executes.

# 5/ The New LONG Trade and Upcoming Catalysts

We have an ER update call on Monday, November 14. The three main events will serve as proof of company execution and are likely to push the price up in the next few weeks.

1. Unfurling of the BW3 satellite is going to happen on November 10. Successful completion is likely to serve as a big catalyst to the stock. Satellite will open up and become operational and ready for testing.

[Furled](https://preview.redd.it/5y3wecosqsx91.png?width=643&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd2ae1d0649d74a9db5fe749c1856a6d70bd0d6e)

[Unfurled](https://preview.redd.it/ew43yfytqsx91.png?width=651&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=916c4d08e26af04ecfd10f47c8a29ee23fe2dce1)

2. Testing of the satellite should happen shortly thereafter and an announcement confirmation of working technology is going to be an even larger event for ASTS. This will be the proof that technology works with MNOs.

3. Other funding or partnership updates, like 5G Fund providing indication of possible financing to ASTS may happen by the end of the year, as well as getting licenses in new jurisdictions (Japan), or more partnerships with MNOs.

[Comments on ASTS eligibility for being financed by FCC's 5G Fund](https://preview.redd.it/g1iknnuvqsx91.png?width=1093&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83b7a48437c40c0dc87d4b6a3f9a2ab964afeb4f)

One of the arguments of sellers is that company will need additional funding before generating meaningful free cash flow. Currently they do have runway to revenue, and that gets even better if the FCC 5G fund awards capital to ASTS or if price stays at $18+ for a month, where warrants become redeemable for $200M of capital. Moreover, there’s other non-dilutive financing options, but regardless I think they’ll be explored in second half of 2023 or later.

&amp;#x200B;

[From spacanpanman](https://preview.redd.it/co5m5bc0rsx91.png?width=1194&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a1991c6fc6b4ae4c8fef5e73a7840c35434eeac)

The reason why I think the moves up on positive news could be violent is because there will be additional buying pressure from bearish traders to get cover their positions in face of good data.

Once ASTS confirms that these events are successful, stock will likely become favored by passive and risk-averse investors, with institutional funds buying in and momentum/breakout traders scaling into positions. I believe we’ll get to $14 area if updates are positive, and a breakout above that is likely to clean the path to $18+ which I think is going to be the turning point for the company, that will set it up for long term success.

Disclaimer, Risks:

Past performance is not indicative of future results. This is not financial advice. There are risks of company failing and stock going to zero.

TLDR:

The no brainer trade this year was to short unprofitable technology and just sit tight. But it is dangerous now, especially on a company like ASTS, which is a powder keg that can explode on successful business developments that are to be announced on November 10 and shortly after. Three upcoming catalysts are likely to serve as a repeat of price action in March and August. Although price is artificially suppressed by the macro environment, once that pressure subsides, the stock will stay high and keep pushing forward as company executes.

Positions: 8,000 shares at $6.27

13,wallstreetbets,DaddyDersch,self.wallstreetbets,16,"11-3-22 SPY/ ES Futures, Apple and Tesla Daily Market Analysis","Well the day after the FOMC meeting proved to be pivotally boring. After a pretty exciting pre market with how red we opened (bless up for my over night puts) we after the first 45 minutes of the day held the same about $3 range all day long. With a love volume red day it seems there is a lot of sidelines money right now and we could end up seeing buyers step back in. I am cautiously optimistic for tomorrow bull wise though. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/un24xy0nrsx91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f21e31cb538ba7322c65e8041bc1f095f301074b

The biggest thing that I mentioned bear wise that happened yesterday was that we broke through key 378 support (green channel). I had mentioned that 370.5 was another big area. I highlighted it here to make it a little more clear. You can see that there is a clear resistance/ support line right there. With SPY breaking through and then holding over it all day and closing over it today I am actually looking for an upside resistance test. 

SPY has put in 4 red days in a row now so it could be expected we get a green day. The other oddity to say the least is that SPY closed down -1.02% and the VIX also closed down -2.28%. Usually I would say that doesn’t happen but in 2022 and lately its happening more and more. Despite everything the JPOW said yesterday the fear isn’t rising in the markets. This is either  sign by the VIX that we should continue to be bullish and expect upside or this is a really “cheap” opportunity to buy some longer DTE puts. 

Bulls will want to defend 370.5 tomorrow again and more or less leave it in the dust and completely gap fill 374.76 tomorrow. From there they need to retest the 378 resistance line and attempt to break back into that zone. 

Bears will want to finally take out 370.5 and close below it with hopes of testing 365 to 359.9 tomorrow and into next week. This is the first time we have had a full candle close below the daily 8ema since before CPI. 

Key support- 370.5 -&gt; 365 -&gt; 359.9

Key resistance- 374.6 -&gt; 378

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at futures we nicely held resistance at 3770 and were not quite able to break through support at 3705. Bulls will look to retake 3770 and possibly key 3805 tomorrow. 

Bears will look to continue the sell off and seek out 3705 and most importantly 3675 support.

Apple looked incredibly heavy compared to the rest of the market and actually was the worst top 10 ticker of the day just barely beating out Google. Interestingly enough Apple is only $3 away from its after hours low of 136 on earnings day. 

Now that Apple is back at the 138.2 support area this is where we can look for it to bounce if it is going to bounce. However, something to keep in mind is that unlike tesla and other stocks Apple has NOT put in its 2nd 52week low… this very well could be its attempt at doing so. 

We have a nice black downward channel inside of a falling wedge that also have a falling wedge inside of the black channel… lol yes I know right? 

Key support- 138.2 -&gt; 135 -&gt; 130

Key resistance- 142.2 -&gt; 144.8

Tesla continues to be all over the place. We did see it break through that “mid” point of 215 today however it was able to find support nicely at 210. However, it did break through the 2 day drop resistance line it was not able to break through and take out the daily 8ema this morning and had a pretty strong rejection there. I will be looking to see if Tesla finds support here with this doji on a downrend which can lead to an upside recovery or if it will indeed retest 205.6 support tomorrow. 

Key support- 214.9 -&gt; 210 -&gt; 205.6

The VIX just absolutely continues to unwind here and doesn’t seem to be phased by anything at all anymore. What will cause the VIX to spike and revery back to the 28-30+ range? Honestly im not sure at this point. The really only big bear event ahead is CPI next Thursday but besides that we have nothing till December. December actually is doing to be a Doozy with CPI on a Tuesday immediately followed the next day by FOMC. 

This CPI still does not have a consensus out… which gives me the same type of vibes from last September CPI which could result in a bigger sell off again. I wouldnt be surprised to see a short rally tomorrow till next week. Markets are looking for that “oh wow yeah lets sell” reason again and I don’t forsee one till CPI. CPI most likely will miss and that’s where it gets complicated. On one hand we know jpow said he isn’t ready to slow or pause… he said inflation aint fixed… so another bad CPI maybe he rockets a 100bps at us? Definitely another 75bps at us… how will markets react? Will we react like September or will we react like October.

We also get to add in the unemployment rate to the mix tomorrow if you remember last month when this hit we had an incredibly red open when this news hits the market.

I am still playing to start the 2.5k challenge… I am refining my strategy on the rules and deciding if I wanna do 2.5k per trade or do a 5k account one trade a day for 10%/ 20% stop loss challenge. I am undecided and will think about it this weekend more.

The ad plan, dubbed ""Basic with Ads,"" will cost $6.99 a month in the U.S. — just below Disney's ad-based price point of $7.99 (which will roll out on December 8.)

""Basic with Ads"" will complement Netflix's existing ad-free tiers and be available in 12 countries, including the U.S., the U.K., Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, and Spain.

The ad tier will feature an average of 4-to-5 minutes of ads per hour. At launch, ads will run 15 or 30 seconds in length, with some running prior to the start of a program while others will be mid-roll ads.

Wall Street analysts are largely bullish on the profitability aspects of the new ad tier, and advertising experts refer to the debut as a make-or-break moment for the media industry.

""It is absolutely a pivotal moment for the industry,"" Kevin Krim, CEO of advertising measurement platform EDO, told Yahoo Finance, citing Amazon's (AMZN) Thursday Night Football as another watershed moment when streaming, subscription, and ad-supported went to the masses.

Looking back, the executive explained, this ""will be the moment where the vast majority of Americans became crystal clear that there's going to be a new way to get the must-watch TV that they care about — and it's going to be through a subscription-based and an ad-supported business model.""

Amid concerns that Netflix subscribers will trade down to the ad-supported version, Citi Managing Director Jason Bazinet previously told Yahoo Finance Live that he views the introduction of advertising as a lucrative revenue driver.

""It's not a spin down risk — it's a spin up opportunity,"" the analyst maintained, estimating that the company could secure $10 or more in advertising revenue per ad-tier subscriber in the U.S.

Based on me being 15% down on my position (7000 shares @ $4.02) and the 2 hours (maybe 1.5) of ""research"" I've done, I have concluded that this stock is underpriced.

The stock is reeling from the news that CVS has likely pulled a purchase offer, but it seems like everyone has forgotten that Humana $HUM is still looking to buy, always had right of first refusal, and is primed to purchase (still up 30% on the year). Both CVS and Humana are desperate to get more of that Medicare Advantage plan money and are basically fighting to buy the company. CVS reportedly stated in their conference call that they are still looking to get into primary care through acquisitions, and failed on their attempt to purchase One Medical who was instead bought by Amazon. Meaning the ""news"" of their pullout is likely bullshit to get $CANO back on sale for the institutions before the actual buyout. Not to mention the market cap of CANO is $1 billion less than the enterprise value (whatever that means, it seems good). Analyst's lowest forecast is $4.04, still giving this an %18 upside worst case scenario and a buyout could reasonably drive this to $12 if not higher. 

In summation, $CANO is an opportunity for free money.",0.54,2,0,2,dd,2022-11-03T18:41:17Z,yl7kw5,t3

Let me explain my theory on profit vs debt","It’s counter intuitive but many companies don’t want to make profit these days. There are many problems with being profitable. First you have to pay tax on profits. Second making profit is actually difficult. Third if you start to make profit it will never be enough for the market and you can’t sell a story of hyper growth company to pump your stocks.

What companies really wanted is asset appreciation whether it be their stocks or real estate. In world of money printing, cheap debt and fiat system, most asset values always go up in price over time. 

Appreciating assets allows businesses to cash out refinance at lower rates. Unlike profit, this borrowed money is tax free as per IRS. The tax free borrowed money is then used to boost revenues through ads, pump stocks thru buybacks &amp; sustain lifestyle of executives and their sugar babies. 

The ponzi continues because some of the borrowed money is used to pump the asset prices. Declining rates help as well. As the debt servicing costs decline it boosts the asset prices allowing businesses to get new round of cash out refinance, pay down smaller debt with bigger debt and continue the ponzi.

Powell grew up in different world where companies actually relied on profits for their liquidity. Not anymore. Business models rely heavily on cheap debt these days. In fact they prefer tax free cheap debt over taxable profits which requires running an efficient business and not just financial engineering.

Powell doesn’t understand simple fact it was the declining rates of last 40 years and access to tax free cheap debt that provided liquidity to businesses and also allowed them to keep prices low for their consumers and inflation in check.

* Shares of Airbnb fell more than 13% Wednesday, a day after the company released third-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street’s estimates but fell short on fourth-quarter guidance.
* For the fourth quarter, Airbnb said it expects to deliver between $1.80 billion and $1.88 billion, below the midpoint of $1.85 billion as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.

Shares of Airbnb fell more than 13% Wednesday, a day after the company released third-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street’s estimates but fell short on fourth-quarter guidance.

Airbnb beat on top and bottom lines in its third quarter. The company posted revenue of $2.9 billion, up 29% year-over-year for its strongest quarter ever, and topped analysts’ estimates of $2.8 billion, according to Refinitiv. The revenue increase was driven by stable growth in the Nights and Experiences booked and elevated average daily rates.

But Airbnb provided fourth-quarter revenue guidance of $1.80 billion and $1.88 billion, below the midpoint of $1.85 billion as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.

Airbnb said to “expect a continued, albeit choppy, recovery of cross-border travel to be a further tailwind to future results” as countries around the world continue to recover from Covid lockdowns and grapple with high levels of inflation and rising interest rates.

7,wallstreetbets,predictany007,self.wallstreetbets,4,"Guggenheim downgrades Roku, citing warning signs after latest quarterly report","Analyst Michael Morris downgraded the television streaming stock to neutral from buy and removed his price target on the name. He previously had a target of $70 per share on Roku.

“We believe in the long-term opportunity for CTV and see Roku’s active account base and operating assets as valuable,” he said in a note to clients, referencing the app CTV that allows users to watch TV. “However, we struggle to value the business given the lack of detail from the company and the warning indicators.”

On Wednesday, the company issued fourth-quarter revenue guidance that was well below expectations, along with a larger-than-expected adjusted EBITDA forecast. Roku did reported a smaller-than-expected loss for the third quarter, but Morris noted those expectations were already slashed as the business has suffered.

He called the fourth-quarter guidance the “primary surprise,” noting it was “well below” prior forecasts and implied revenue declines due to a drop in up-front spending from advertisers. But he still expects the company to beat when reporting fourth-quarter earnings.

Fourth-quarter total net revenue guidance was predicted by Guggenheim to be 1% lower than the same quarter a year ago. The firm previously expected it to grow 4% in the quarter. Ad revenue is expected to decline 5% in the quarter after being forecast to grow by 7%, while total platform revenue should grow 0.5% compared to the 6% growth expected before the earnings call.

Morris said there is concern over the magnitude of the soft cyclical environments impact on advertising space not bought at the “upfront” event.

Meanwhile, he said the company is still operating at a loss and is likely to increase spending if conditions improve. He also pointed to what he called a lack of visibility into the company’s business drivers such as advertising revenue trends, investment goals and profitability objectives that make it hard to predict future performance.

The stock plummeted 19% in premarket trading following the earnings release Wednesday. Roku has taken a beating this year, losing more than 76.2% through Wednesday’s close.

On Nov. 1st, Uber reported better-than-expected quarterly results. It reported an adjusted loss of 61 cents a share on revenue of $8.34 billion. Analysts expected Uber to report a loss of 18 cents a share on revenue of $8.1 billion. 

Uber's total gross bookings were $29.12 billion, slightly below expectations of $29.67 billion. But the company expects total fourth-quarter bookings to rise 23% to 27% from a year earlier. Uber also gave its fourth-quarter profit before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) guidance range of $600 million to $630 million. Wall Street was expecting $567 million.

Meanwhile, UBER also sees positive comments from Evercore ISI’s Tech analyst Mark Mahaney and Wedbush’s analyst Dan Ives. According to Mark Mahaney, Uber is part of the $2 trillion global ride-sharing and delivery market. He thinks the company is on track to grow bookings by about 30% from its current 90 million customers.

""Uber is continuing to see healthy growth as the driver shortage is essentially over while the company continues to benefit from travel returning, shifting to the office, as other post-pandemic trends continue to hold globally with Uber poised to benefit into 2023,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to clients.

21,wallstreetbets,Guilty-Ham,self.wallstreetbets,83,‘Dramatic increase.’ Foreclosure filings are up more than 150%. Here’s what that tells us about the housing market,"The number of foreclosure starts — which is when the first public foreclosure notice happens — is up 219% since the start of the year, according to real estate data analytics firm ATTOM Data Solutions’ midyear 2022 U.S. foreclosure market report. What’s more, the number of properties that had foreclosure filings (this number includes foreclosure starts) is up 153% from the same time period last year. 

Fully 96% of major metro areas saw an annual increase in foreclosure filings, with foreclosure rates highest in Illinois, New Jersey and Ohio. And when it comes to the number of foreclosure starts, California topped the list, followed by Florida, Tennessee, Illinois and Ohio.

“Foreclosure activity across the United States continued its slow, steady climb back to pre-pandemic levels in the first half of 2022,” says Rick Sharga, executive vice president of market intelligence at ATTOM. “While overall foreclosure activity is still running significantly below historic averages, the dramatic increase in foreclosure starts suggests that we may be back to normal levels by sometime in early 2023,” says Sharga. (See the lowest mortgage rates you can get here.)
What does this uptick in foreclosures mean for the housing market?

Foreclosures are shooting up as the various foreclosure moratoriums that kept people in their homes during the worst of the pandemic’s economic disruptions have now ended, explains Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com. That said, they are shooting up from extremely low levels, she adds — noting that even after the sharp increase in foreclosure activity observed in the first half of 2022, we’re still not back to 2019’s low pre-pandemic mid-year total.

“Much like the sharp turnaround in housing inventory that we’ve observed in the number of for-sale homes recently, when the market has tilted in one direction very extremely, we see huge percentage increases when the trends shift back in a different direction, even though in many aspects what we’re witnessing is just a return to something resembling what was once normal,” says Hale.

Indeed, “it’s important to note that many of the foreclosure starts we’re seeing today — in fact, much of the overall foreclosure activity we’re seeing right now is on loans that were either already in foreclosure or were more than 120 days delinquent prior to the pandemic,” says Sharga. Indeed, many of these loans were protected by the foreclosure moratorium put in place by the government during the pandemic — therefore just halting the inevitable by a couple of years. Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate says, “Foreclosure activity is returning to normal levels after being artificially depressed by pandemic-induced payment relief programs and extended foreclosure moratoriums. In a historical context, foreclosures are still very low.”

And while these foreclosure numbers sound dramatic, Holden Lewis, home and mortgage expert at NerdWallet, says it’s not enough to make a dent in the housing market or the overall economy. “Even a healthy housing market has foreclosures, and this pace is nothing to worry about,” says Lewis.
What does this mean for buyers?

While foreclosures remain unfortunate for the owners of those homes, for shoppers who have been frustrated by the lack of homes for sale in their budget, the increase in foreclosures could bring additional options, says Hale. “But much like the increases we see in for-sale housing inventory, it’s just the first step. We would need to see many more months of these increases before home shoppers will feel like they have an abundance of homes to choose from,” says Hale. source without paywall: https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marketwatch.com%2Fpicks%2Fdramatic-increase-foreclosure-filings-are-up-more-than-150-heres-what-that-tells-us-about-the-housing-market-01659181360",0.93,100,0,100,news,2022-11-03T10:01:19Z,ykvrzo,t3

* Fed is trying to give investors hope by slowing of rate hike pace but not pivoting at the same time.
* It takes 9-12 months for rate hikes to be felt and 12-18 months for the maximum effect. It makes sense to slow down the current pace given we are only eight months past the first rate hike.
* Fed will want slower total and core inflation, pullbacks in house prices and rents, slower wage growth, lower job openings, and likely an increase in the unemployment rate prior to a real pivot.
* Fed is also concerned about the upcoming winter heating season that may cause another spike in energy prices.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%. (Stats as of 2022-10-28)",0.77,11,0,11,dd,2022-11-03T04:30:07Z,ykpuun,t3

Does that mean earnings is likely going be bad?  As they could of announced this “somewhat” good news on earnings, but decided to issues the news a day prior to earnings.

The specific company I am talking about is Virgin Galactic SPCE.  Earnings is tomorrow and while they have no earnings the expectation is that their spaceship fleet is ready to fly.  However might get delayed.

Today they provided a update that they have found suppliers for their next generation fleet.

88,wallstreetbets,0x11C3P,self.wallstreetbets,16,Fed Talk + JPOW opinions,"I closed out my puts today for some modest gains. Listening through the meeting and listening it through it again, I do sense a bit dovishness in his speech. More so than I had originally anticipated looking at the underlying economic data. Caveat to that is it really involves one thing, the rate of increase, not overall Fed Fund rate increase. On the latter, it looks like he's taking that 25 bps and going to push it towards the Feb meeting. I'm overall still bearish for the time being. 

The rate hike that I initially anticipated would be 75 bps for December. It's looking highly more likely that'll it'll be 50 bps. That said, it's looking way more likely that Feb will be 50 bps increase as well in 2023 and will hold it there. That'll push it towards the 4.75%-5% range.

That said, if economic data doesn't improve halfway through this month going past December, I'm thinking they'll keep pushing rates into Q2 2023 most likely in 25 bps range pushing it over the 5% Fed fund rate point. 

Plan your strategies accordingly and expect a bumpy ride. This latest messaging was less clear with mixed economic data coming.

Powell agreed there wil at some point be a time to slow rate… however, he confirmed that time is not now and it would be pre-mature… The question that will remain now is was this some unbelievably wild over reaction to what JPOW said or did we just witness the top get put in? There is a case to be made for both that’s for sure.

I had posted this to the server and would I say that this strategy worked? Yes but also no at the same time…

I took the 389C overnight and that was looking rough for a really long time this morning. Thankfully with the rogue pump before FOMC and then the 2pm pump that was expected I exited for a pretty decent win. Not the best exit but when its moving like that it’s the best you can do for sure. 

That pump also allowed me as expected to exit my now 5dte 386C too for almost 20% win.

I did follow my plan of the 234pm calls. I entered and hit 30% profits pretty much instantly… unfortunately that was where the music stopped playing for me. I fully expected based on movement that we were going to see a really big bullish break out on SPY after the 230 presser as historically has happened. However, it dumped pretty much immediately after I entered. I never saw green again and there was no sense to average down or try to do anything silly. 

If you were okay with small profits it did hit, however, if you weren’t fast it turned into a loss.

Someone asked me last night “why don’t you present a bearish case too?” well until today there wasn’t really a reason to present one. What do I mean by that? Well we had been holding this red bull channel for over 3 weeks now. There was little reason to bet against that until we saw like now a breakdown of that support. 

With SPY now breaking through that green channel support of 378.1 and not only that it also rejected the attempted break through of 388.6 resistance I do favor a bearish case now. With the blue resistance line and red bull channel support line there was also a rising wedge formed that has now broken. 

From here we look at our key levels which will be that 378.1 resistance level. If SPY can break back through there and close over that level tomorrow there actually could be a case made that today was some massive over reaction and we are going to see a reversion to mean break to the upside 385 range tomorrow. However, if we back test and reject 378.1 that is even more confirmation of downside to come. 

If you remember since last CPI the media was screaming a fed pivot and a fed slowing of rate hikes. Overall JPOW effectively just said that is NOT happening right now but in the future will happen. With that narrative now squashed where are we going to go next? The next thing on the Agenda is CPI on November 10th which so far we still do not have a consensus on core or CPI yet. However, monthly CPI is consensus of 0.7 which would be a 0.3% rise over previous MoM. I expect that CPI to release soon and I expect that could absolutely move the markets. 

Key support- 374.6 -&gt; 370.5 -&gt; 365

Key resistance- 378.1 -&gt; 379.9 -&gt; 384.1 -&gt; 388.6

Futures does not look any better then SPY and has broken through the red bull channel support also and landed at 3760 support. This will be the next support that bears what to try to take out. Bulls will look to get this back over 3865 by EOW if they want to remain bullish going forward. 

One major bearish thing we can take away here is that this week effectively was a daily 100ema rejection and now huge break down through daily 8 and 20ema. The bearish case is rising in strength. 

Key support- 3705 -&gt; 3675 -&gt; 3585

Key resistance- 3800 -&gt; 3865 -&gt; 3925

Apple actually was the last domino to fall today and even more interestingly about Apple it has officially broken through the bottom from Friday. That huge green day that Apple had on Friday is now completely gone and then some. 

With this bull channel now broken we are looking at downside obviously now too. It is hard to tell in this picture because if I zoomed out too far it would be hard to see the candles but we are actually seeing quite a bit of red. Looking at the daily you can see that 150.6 is the KEY pivot level of bullish vs. bearish and we are seeing a pretty aggressive rejection of the daily 100 and 200ema which I mentioned earlier would take a few trading days to play out. 

Key support- 144.7 -&gt; 141.1 -&gt; 138.2 

Key resistance- 149.2 -&gt; 150.6 -&gt; 153.4 -&gt; 155.4

They really did massacre my girl Tesla today. I was actually impressively bullish on tesla with that closure over key 230 and the candle body over the daily 20ema which fully closing over the daily 8ema. However, we just saw a pretty massive rejection of the daily 20ema today and closure just above key support at 214.9. 

Key support- 214.9 -&gt; 210 -&gt; 205.6

Key resistance- 219.4 -&gt; 225.8 -&gt; 229.9

What would a -2.5% red day on SPY be without the VIX closing barely green at 0.12%... Well I had imagined they were unwinding the VIX for FOMC and especially for CPI next week, however, I would have expected to see a reaction on the VIX especially with this dump. There is clearly still fear and unknown in this market thanks to JPOW today, however, the VIX didn’t really react. Will it react tomorrow? Or is this going to end up being a straight volume dump with VIX once again being detached? 

Daily log- 

Well I am going to start doing these a little differently! I am going to start a 2.5k 10% take profit/ 20% stop loss challenge. So EOD you will see me post my daily log and post results of a 2.55k challenge. I will probably end up making a separate post for the 2.5k challenge also. For me usually my first trade of the day is my best trade so I will utilize my first entry for the trade. I will use the full $2500 per trade (well as close as I can) and I will update this via Excel like my normal port. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1g4jz5ebqlx91.png?width=828&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05a2491de9d015a29655f9088fa96de3697abc0f

I will start the challenge tomorrow just going to move a few things around in my accounts. Now the thing with this is that it is NOT about full porting… that’s absolutely not what im doing this for and $5000 is not a full port for me. What I am doing instead is hoping to show you guys whether its $500, $1000, $2500, $10,000, etc. etc. If you have proper strategy and risk management and take small profits those small profits will add up over time. This is to show you compound growth. Yes one loss of 20% does set you back two 10% wins, but if you continue to trade the $2,500 it adds up and recovers fairly quickly. 

This is not a full port as I said… I will be utilizing $2,500 PER TRADE so as you see above the starting “balance” is $2,500 but that’s not all that is in there. In the future I may do another one of just one trade a day starting with like $5,000 or something in the account and attempt to grow that… the same premise remains though that as long as you maintain a good strategy one loss really only takes 2-3 trades to over come. With premiums being so ridiculous right now it’s a little hard to use less then $2,500 and even some days $2,500 will be a stretch but like I said it will be as close to $2,500 as it can be. 

I will continue to trade normally in my other account doing day traders/ scalps and of course my level to levels.

Not my best day but not my worse day. The important lesson today was no matter how highly probable a trade is… it can ALWAYS go against you and not only that… it is only a high probability trade if we remember to take profits. These trades that are the “big hitters” have to be lotto size and you have to understand that as you see above there is a chance it goes straight to zero.

10,wallstreetbets,Annual_Equipment_370,self.wallstreetbets,54,I'm pivoting,"Wow, I'm just gonna cash out, delete my brokerage app and forget about fucking stocks forever.  
This week I've accurately used my 3 pre-PDT trades to gain $500 and get rid of this status right before today's shitstorm. I was sitting in cash, 25.2k, just waiting for the FOMC, playing chess and thinking that I'm probably done for today unless market chooses a clear direction after the meeting. Then I see a notification on my phone. YOUR POSITION MAY BE LIQUIDATED.   


wat?  


I opened the app and saw that I'm fucking shorting SQQQ at 52.00 and it's 53.50 now. I forgot to cancel one of the stop orders and went short on margin. I freaked out, tried to cancel the trade via app support and set a buy order at 52.11. Eventually the position was closed at this price and I only lost like $50 on that. And a shitload on neurones.  


After I closed the position, I had a chat with my gf about all the situation, we freaked out, but I felt lucky to escape a potential infinite loss.   


So, happy end, huh? I've evaded PDT status by doing two good trades and dodged this short margin position liquidation.  


Well, after some time I saw a bunch of enormous green dicks on SQQQ chart, realised that market has decided to finally dump and I still can join the trend, bought some SQQQ at 56.00, with default stop loss at 55.00 and profit taker at 57.00. Right after my order was filled, the stonk started to tank. I felt stressed af. It was too much for today and just wanted to exit the trade, fuck off and chill till tomorrow. Instead of closing it with minimal loss, I just watched SQQQ dropped to 55, lost $500, received PDT status, then in half an hour SQQQ jumped to 58, and to 59 in another half an hour. So if I haven't initialised the trade, I would've been +$450 today. If I've sold at a $100 loss, I'd still be fine. If I've managed my stop loss according to volatility, I would've been + extra $1k at close.  


Instead, I'm banned from trading for 90 days. I just watch the market rapidly tanking, feel even more FOMO and self-hatred for being stupid enough to do some emotional trades after such a day and risking my 25k PDT limit. I can't deposit extra money to the account, because my Ukrainian bank doesn't allow me to send USD abroad due to war time restrictions.  


I was waiting for this fucking FOMC and upcoming 52w lows during this whole bullshit rally month, hoping to ride the SQQQ till SPY @ 360. Now I'm fucked, my plan is fucked, finances are fucked. Total loss: $5k. Not as devastating as some of you apes have, but painful enough, and I won't be able to manage this loss in the next 90 days, maybe never, I just feel sick from these fucking candles. Maybe I'll just buy virgin IVW in Feb and maybe will be able to cover my losses in 5 years with the help of cOmPoUnD iNtErEsT. If we won't die in fucking great nuclear war recession till then.

# Final Comment

&amp;#x200B;

AMC is a heavily indebted company; the leverage is unsustainable, and the company is struggling to have positive net income. Its Cash Burning Rate is at 2.56, meaning its spending 2.5 times more its cash availability, giving the company a life expectancy of 30 moths with its current cash &amp; cash equivalents. It will need to cash in accounts receivables to extend more its life expectancy.

Income quality dropped drastically since 2018, it means that total earnings do not correspond to the actual cash intake from its operations.

Cash Ration indicate that the company will struggle to pay its current liabilities with its current cash.

Without  a drastic change in its fundamentals, the company is in high risk.

It is advisable to keep an eye on the Company operations and Management Action and evaluate possible adjustments for the final pricing without any changes in trends, the company is destined to die.

Long term forecast is more pessimistic than previously forecasted. 


IMO they will get interest rates close to core inflation and see how much it slows down inflation. Then they may increase it further for a full on recession to bring prices down by killing the economy. 


If core inflation does start going down through Q4 and early 2023, we will see slower rate increases. If stays high, we're going to 6% very fast.

72,wallstreetbets,predictany007,self.wallstreetbets,12,Fed approves 0.75-point hike to take rates to highest since 2008 and hints at change in policy ahead,"The Federal Reserve on Wednesday approved a fourth consecutive three-quarter point interest rate increase and signaled a potential change in how it will approach monetary policy to bring down inflation.

In a well-telegraphed move that markets had been expecting for weeks, the central bank raised its short-term borrowing rate by 0.75 percentage point to a target range of 3.75%-4%, the highest level since January 2008.

The move continued the most aggressive pace of monetary policy tightening since the early 1980s, the last time inflation ran this high.

Along with anticipating the rate hike, markets also had been looking for language indicating that this could be the last 0.75-point, or 75 basis point, move. Specifically, some Fed officials along with Wall Street economists and strategists in recent weeks had talked of a “step-down” in policy that could see a rate increase of half a point at the December meeting and then a few smaller hikes in 2023.

That language was not overt in the post-meeting statement from the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, though there was a tweak that could point to an adjustment in policy.

This week’s statement expanded on previous language simply declaring that “ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate.“

The new language read: “The Committee anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time.“

The statement reiterated that policy changes “will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.“

Markets will look to Chairman Jerome Powell’s news conference at 2:30 p.m. for more clarity on whether the Fed thinks it can implement less restrictive policy that would include a less dramatic level of rate hikes to achieve its inflation goals.

Along with the tweak in the statement, the FOMC again categorized growth in spending and production as “modest” and noted that “job gains have been robust in recent months” while inflation is “elevated.” The statement also reiterated language that the committee is “highly attentive to inflation risks.“

The rate increase comes as recent inflation readings show prices remain near 40-year highs. A historically tight jobs market in which there are nearly two openings for every unemployed worker is pushing up wages, a trend the Fed is seeking to head off as it tightens money supply.

Concerns are rising that the Fed, in its efforts to bring down the cost of living, also will pull the economy into recession. Powell has said he still sees a path to a “soft landing” in which there is not a severe contraction, but the U.S. economy this year has shown virtually no growth even as the full impact from the rate hikes has yet to kick in.

At the same time, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure showed the cost of living rose 6.2% in September from a year ago – 5.1% even excluding food and energy costs. GDP declined in both the first and second quarters, meeting a common definition of recession, though it rebounded to 2.6% in the third quarter largely because of an unusual rise in exports. At the same time, housing prices have plunged as 30-year mortgage rates have soared past 7% in recent days.

On Wall Street, markets have been rallying in anticipation that the Fed soon might start to ease back as worries grow over the longer-term impact of higher rates.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained more than 13% over the past month, in part because of an earnings season that wasn’t as bad as feared but also amid growing hopes for a recalibration of Fed policy. Treasury yields also have come off their highest levels since the early days of the financial crisis, though they remain elevated. The benchmark 10-year note most recently was around 4.04%.

There is little if any expectation that the rate hikes will halt anytime soon, so the anticipation is just on a slower pace. Futures traders are pricing a near coin-flip chance of a half-point increase in December, against another three-quarter point move.

Current market pricing also indicates the fed funds rate will top out near 5% before the rate hikes cease.

The fed funds rate sets the level that banks charge each other for overnight loans, but spills over into multiple other consumer debt instruments such as adjustable-rate mortgages, auto loans and credit cards.

Listen, Zuck MIGHT be an absolute regard and Meta MIGHT be the downfall of his company, but I hardly believe that’s the case. Take VR-chat for example, I have seen lots of people compare meta with vr-chat pointing out that there already is an existing product that currently, beats meta in regards to graphics and so on. But meta was and isnt meant to be like vr-chat. Vr-chat didnt change gaming or gaming trends in basically any shape or form. We still use our systems and most of us would never switch to vr when we have pc and other standard gaming consoles. So why would meta try to create an already existing product, which has proven to not be very successfull? Well I think the answer is simple, they’re not doing that. The massive spending everyone is constantly reffering to is obviously not spent on the graphics or how it ”looks”, but the engine and the software, that currently (as shown by vr-chat), is very underdeveloped. The product isnt and was never meant to be operational or used right now, but everyone seems to think that because of the massive spending, bad graphics and an unfinished product, meta is DOOMED. I believe that there is profound potential in the metaverse because of the massive spendings, not the other way around. People want groundbreaking technology that potentially could represent reality, but act suprised when it turns out the cost of such a system to be built, is massive. Regarded sheep mindset.

Rates in have to be above the rate of inflation. 

For example, if you get a mortgage at current rates, about 7% and the rate of inflation is at 8.1%, you are borrowing money at a rate that is lower than inflation, which is not considered restrictive, or that it is stiil cheaper to borrow vs the appreciation of a commodity or asset.

The dilemma that jpow faces, is the time lag theory, which states that for each rate hike, it takes at minimum 6 months for for it to effect in the economy. The totality of  the effects of the rate hikes will really not be known until mid 2023. So no one really knows what the actual effects of hikes will do.

3.) Risk assets have rallied during the last weeks

Yes they are excellent products with absolutely outstanding performances compared to other products out in the market. Still, yet a LOT of people who buy apple products can save a fortune by picking other products other than the standard MacBook or the iPhone.

If apple was a growing company aspiring to eat up a lot of the marketplace in the future then the reason for their growth would be pretty obvious. But they're not. It's not like they're starting to insert ads within the ios to increase their revenue. Their one and only source of profit is (mostly) their Apple products. Phones, Laptops, and Tablets that are more than outstanding in quality but also have a significantly higher price tag compared to other products.

It's making people buy the same iPhone again and more (well, not the same but you can still work longer with your previous iPhone.). I don't think Apple would be able to grow this much if people only bought a single iPhone to replace their previous iPhone every three years when their iPhone finally dies.  For some reason they're making the same people buy so much apple products again although their extremely high price tag. Something like buying another iPhone in a shorter span. Or buying other Apple products as well after purchasing your iPhone. Adding a new Macbook in your shopping cart although your previous one is still good.

Seems like people LOVE the iPhone. Yes it's a cult, it's almost something like a new religion

&amp;#x200B;

They don't really have a lot of new customers out there to purchase their first iPhone. Yet the company is still GROWING. A LOT

&amp;#x200B;

Is it the marketing? Is it because of product quality?

&amp;#x200B;

How is the company still GROWING?

&amp;#x200B;

or am i missing something?

26,wallstreetbets,predictany007,self.wallstreetbets,16,Amazon has exited the trillion-dollar club. Sell-off pushes market cap below $1 trillion for first time since April 2020," 

* Amazon’s stock closed down Tuesday for a fifth straight day, falling to the lowest since April 2020.
* Last week the company projected sales in the holiday quarter would be far below expectations.
* The stock dropped 5.9% to $96.79.
* Amazon has exited the trillion-dollar club.

Shares of the e-retailer plunged 5.9% on Tuesday, falling for a fifth straight day and closing at their lowest since April 2020. The sell-off has erased almost all of the stock’s pandemic surge.

Investors continued to punish the company for last week’s disappointing fourth-quarter forecast. Amazon said revenue during the holiday quarter would grow 2% to 8% over the year-ago period, far below analysts’ estimates. The cloud division, Amazon Web Services, also reported weaker-than-expected sales.

It’s the first time Amazon’s market cap has been below $1 trillion since April 2020. The stock has plunged 42% in 2022 and is on pace for its worst year since 2008, when it dropped 45%. The only other year that was worse was during the dot-com crash of 2000, when the company lost 80% of its value.

Like the rest of Big Tech, Amazon has struggled this year due to a slumping economy, soaring inflation and rising interest rates. On top of that, Amazon has been forced to scale back after expanding dramatically during the pandemic, now that consumers have returned to stores.

Amazon has been the second-worst performer in the Big Tech group this year, behind Facebook parent Meta, which has plummeted 72%. Meta told investors last week that revenue in the fourth quarter would likely decline for a third straight period.

Captivating **TL;DR** today - **number go up.** Purchases are u**p 345% ($4.9M to $22M)** from the prior week along with sales, which increased +290% ($263M to $1B). The bulk of purchases stems from insiders at Mobileye Global Inc within the IT sector / Electronic Equipment industry. Active insiders and companies are up 18% and 25% respectively from the prior week.

# High-Level Stats:

* Purchases increased from $4.9M to $22M (+345%)
* Sales increased from $263.5M to $1.02B (+290%)
* Transactions increased from 267 to 316 (+18%)
* Companies represented in Form 4s increased from 170 to 200 (+18%)
   * Net buyers increased from 14 to 23 (+64%)
   * Net sellers increased from 156 to 177 (+13%)
* Insiders filing Form 4s increased from 234 to 292 (+25%)
   * Net buyers increased from 25 to 38 (52%)
   * Net sellers increased from 209 to 254 (+22%)

# Transaction Selection

1. **All** **Direct Open Market Transactions** from **October 24th - October 28th.** These are Form 4 filings with a Transaction Code of “P” or “S”. This narrows the scope to trades where insiders are putting their money on the line.
2. Weekly comparisons are to transactions from **October 17th - October 21st.**
3. **No companies without a ticker** (e.g. opportunity/income/mutual funds).

# Further Context

1. Form 4 data is impacted by a concept known as **backfill** which is par for the course with transactional data. The delay between the Filing Date and the Transaction Date is **\*roughly\*** 2 days and your mileage will vary. This means that **more transactions for past dates can arrive in future filings.** That is why looking at larger trends is key.
2. To combat backfill, filings through this Tuesday are included **\*if\*** the transaction date is from the prior week. Otherwise, transactions from this week are excluded.
3. Data is sourced by the algorithms behind [Form Fore](http://formfore.io/)

# Feedback/Updates

* All feedback, **good bad, and ugly** are welcome - aiming to make these as helpful as possible.
* The **public workbook** should be ready for initial release **sometime next week**. Will also share on Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/FormFore) if that is your preferred hub.
* The newsletter is likely a few weeks out and on my radar. I appreciate your patience!

(TRULIEVE, VERANO, GREENTHUMB, CRESCO, CURALEAF) 

Ontario, Canada-based licensed cannabis producer Canopy Growth’s plans to launch Canopy USA to accelerate its acquisitions of three American marijuana companies and remain listed on a major stock exchange might have provided a blueprint for U.S. companies.

American cannabis operators who touch the plant could follow the Canopy road map to uplist from the Canadian Securities Exchange to the Toronto Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq – provided they’re willing to do a major restructuring, experts told MJBizDaily.

The upside to listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), North America’s third-largest exchange, is that it could help cannabis companies attract more institutional investment.

So far, American plant-touching cannabis companies – such as multistate operators – haven’t been able to raise capital on major exchanges because of the federal illegality of cannabis in the U.S., opting instead to list on the Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE) and over-the-counter markets.

And that might still be a problem, at least for the Nasdaq, which expressed objections to Canopy’s plans and could delist the Smiths Falls-based company.

But the TSX has been more receptive, which could provide U.S. plant-touching operators an avenue for uplisting without waiting for the federal government to legalize marijuana or implement other major cannabis reforms.

In an email to MJBizDaily, Catherine Kee, spokesperson at TSX parent TMX Group, confirmed that Canopy worked directly with the exchange and shared its plans in advance of the announcement.

Kee declined to comment on whether U.S. companies could follow.

“We are aware that legislation applicable to the marijuana sector is evolving,” Kee said. “TMX continues to monitor the developments with interest and we remain committed to supporting the enduring success of the cannabis industry.”

In a note, equity analyst Owen Bennett of New York-based investment bank Jefferies Group wrote that the Toronto Stock Exchange’s approval of a Canopy listing could have major implications for U.S. operators through more M&amp;A by Canadian acquirers and/or enabling “U.S. (operators) to adopt the same structure and uplist to the TSX.”

Restructuring ‘gymnastics’
Kelly Fair – a partner with the international law firm Dentons and external counsel to Canopy’s new holding company Canopy USA – told MJBizDaily she’s proud of the creative approach she and the Canopy team have taken to accelerate U.S. market exposure.

Canopy USA will have a ring-fenced structure in which Canopy Growth would hold nonvoting, exchangeable shares in the holding company, segregating those U.S. assets from the rest of the company.


“To the extent that the substructure is embraced by at least the TSX, then that would provide the opportunity to the U.S. (multistate operators to uplist) potentially sooner than a full legalization event – if they wanted to go through the gymnastics to do structuring like this,” Fair said.

Any MSO looking to uplist would have to create a ring-fenced structure between the listed company and the company that’s actually touching the plant or holding the plant-touching entities, she said.

The pros and cons

Matt Karnes, founder of Greenwave Advisors, told MJBizDaily via email that the TSX is more expensive to list on than the CSE, but that it has more liquidity and more stringent listing requirements – which are both more appealing to institutional investors.

He also said Canopy could try to use TSX approval to pressure the Nasdaq to allow U.S. plant-touching businesses to list.

Another hitch, however, is whether Canopy’s auditors will sign off on consolidated financials that include plant-touching operations in the U.S.

“The Big 4 (accounting firms) have not engaged in U.S. cannabis thus far and this could signal a willingness to accept U.S. cannabis clients – a positive for U.S. cannabis as it gives added assurance to institutional investors as to the industry’s legitimacy,” he said.

Whatever happens, Karnes  believes U.S. multistate operators will follow Canopy’s lead, particularly if they don’t want to wait for legislation such as the Safe and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act that could pass during this lame-duck session of Congress.

“I think whatever path Canopy Growth USA takes, the MSOs will follow, and they don’t necessarily have to wait to see what happens with SAFE.”

40,wallstreetbets,Suspicious-Word-9514,self.wallstreetbets,19,"Macroscope | The Fed meeting preview: 4th 75bps rate-hike is on the way, is pivot coming next?","The Fed's two-day November meeting will end on Wednesday, and the market has well expected its fourth consecutive aggressive 75 basis point rate hike, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. The probability of a 75 basis point rate hike has reached as high as 85.5%, which would raise the federal funds rate to a range of 3.75%-4%, the highest level since 2008.

However, given the recent signals released by the Fed to slow down interest rate hikes, the market is likely to be more concerned about further signals from the Fed after the rate meeting on plans for a December rate hike and the direction of monetary policy next year. The Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has been vocal about the need to slow the pace of interest rate hikes at some point since July, and analysts believe he may also reiterate that point at this meeting. Additionally, a report by the ""New Fed Wire"" last week about the possibility of a slowdown in the Fed's aggressive policy in December continued to gather steam, with medium and long-term US bond yields topping out after hitting yearly highs.

Bloomberg economists said what is less certain is how Powell will communicate a potential future downshift in the rate-hike pace -- the degree of conviction, the risks around hike sizing, and implications for the terminal rate. Economists expect Powell to use 50 basis points present a 50-basis-point move as the base case and clarify that a downshift in the pace of rate hikes does not necessarily mean a lower terminal rate.

It is worth noting that the Fed’s November meeting is also just less than a week before the US mid-term elections. Undoubtedly, how to deal with the Republicans on the high-rise inflation and the risk of recession will become a major problem for Biden. And just last week, two Democratic senators urged Powell not to cause unnecessary pain by over-raising interest rates.

It has been said that there are now major divergences within the Fed on monetary policy. For example, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daley thinks the Fed should start discussions on slowing down rate hikes to avoid sending the economy into an ""unforced slump"". But Kansas Fed President Esther George believes that monetary policy needs to move into a restrictive range, and the strength remains to be watched. Given the recent volatility in the financial markets and the time it takes for interest rate hikes to affect the economy, the Fed cannot act too hastily.

There are also a few views that do not favour a pivot. Fed governor Michelle Bowman hopes to look for signs of falling inflation before slowing down the rate hike. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said he hopes to raise the policy rate to a level that would put meaningful downward pressure on inflation.

Therefore, for this meeting, FOMC members are expected to engage in a heated debate on how to steer interest rates to avoid a troubled economy.

“They may want to go slower just in the interest of financial stability,” said Julia Coronado, the founder of MacroPolicy Perspectives LLC. “It’s a challenge for messaging because they don’t want to ease financial conditions significantly. They need tight financial conditions to keep cooling the economy off. So he (Powell) doesn’t want to sound dovish, but he may want to go slower.”

Some institutions took a relatively cautious view. Nomura believes that the FOMC does not yet seem to have a consensus on the preferred size of a December rate hike, which will limit Powell's ability to provide guidance. The Fed chairman will reiterate that future policy will depend on economic data, including the two non-farm payrolls reports and, most importantly, the latest inflation data. Barclays also released a report saying that the Fed may leave its December policy options open, pending more information on inflation and tightening risks.

The [J.P. Morgan](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NYSE-JPM/) team, on the other hand, made relatively “accurate “predictions on the outcome of this meeting. Analysts believe the most likely scenario going to happen is a 75 basis point rate hike and a hawkish press release, which could allow Powell to retain selectivity for December and next year meetings, while highlighting the current risks of higher inflation. In this scenario, S&amp;P 500 may float between down 1% to up 0.5%. And if the Fed provides clear guidance for the December meeting, this is likely to be seen as dovish and S&amp;P 500 could rise by 2.5%-3%.

In addition, former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers also tweeted recently, saying that the “growing chorus” for the Fed to pause interest rate hikes very soon is “badly misguided.” In his view, the Fed should stick to its current course and not pause too soon, especially given that it has a history of “past errors”.

Aside from rate hikes, let's not forget the glooming recession hanging over the US. Concerns were fuelled last week by the inversion in the 3-month/10-year US bond yields. Prior to this, the 2/10-year US bond inversion had been going on for almost five months. Given the historically extremely high success rate of both yield curves in predicting crisis, there is growing concern about how the Federal Reserve will respond to outside concerns about the economy.

Notably, Jerome Powell had said in the press conference after the September meeting that the goal of fighting inflation had not changed and would be maintained until the task completed, and the federal funds rate would need to be kept at a restrictive level for a certain time. But the FOMC had already revised down the US economic growth rate to 0.2% this year.

It is worth noting that while consumers, the engine of the US economy, are still maintaining spending in the face of inflationary pressures, danger signals are beginning to reveal. The US Department of Commerce said last week that consumer spending growth slowed to a near two-year low of 1.4% from 2.0% in the previous quarter, and consumer purchasing power continues to retreat at a 3% rate and US families are gradually running out of federal financial subsidies in the COVID pandemic.",0.79,11,0,11,question,2022-11-02T14:27:47Z,yk3wmu,t3

Instead he’s basically building a shitty gaming studio and over spending like crazy on it instead of paying a few billion to have it made.

""The Qatar Investment Authority plans to increase its stake in Credit Suisse by investing in a share sale alongside Saudi National Bank, according to people with knowledge of the talks.

""Saudi National Bank — whose own largest shareholder is the Public Investment Fund, the Saudi sovereign wealth fund — has agreed to invest SFr1.5bn in Credit Suisse for a 9.9 per cent stake.  While the majority of the investment will be made through a SFr1.76bn initial share placement, to be signed off at an extraordinary general meeting on November 23, Saudi National Bank will also take part in a SFr2.24bn rights issue later in the year.  Saudi National Bank will be joined by two other investors in the share placement, including QIA, which already owns 5 per cent of Credit Suisse stock.

55,wallstreetbets,asmit10,self.wallstreetbets,4,$CCJ - Uranium Miner trying to break out of a 8 year downtrend,"$CCJ

Camerco claims:

Uranium inventories are low

Secondary supply is low

Nobody has been investing in supply

‘never started a cycle with this high of a uranium price’

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Camerco appears to be a good steward of capital and understands the market dynamics involved with being a supplier of a not-so-rare mineral

Camerco had \~10% of world uranium production in 2021

China adding \~150 nuclear power plants by 2035

China’s nuclear power generation in the past 10 years has been so great - that it has made up for Europe’s staunch stance on decommissioning - leading to the largest nuclear power plant power generation of all time in 2021. It is conceivable that the west is beginning to realize their mistake and are beginning the process of fixing it, out of necessity from Russia’s and Saudi Arabia’s oil cartel.

Yes, oil manufacturing is going to spike. Oil supply will eventually outpace demand, the Russian war will end, and energy prices will stabilize…but with China investing so much into low-cost energy, will the west want to remain dependent on Russia for economic stability?

Even the most anti-nuclear governments are temporarily halting their decision to decommission 30 year old plants

200 - 400 nuclear power plants to be decommissioned by 2040

Camerco recently announced a deal to buy Westinghouse..

…and Poland just announced they’re building their first nuclear power plant and chose the U.S. and Westinghouse to build their first Nuclear Power Plant.

According to [World-nuclear.org](https://World-nuclear.org): 

About 90 power reactors with a total gross capacity of about 90,000 MWe are on order or planned, and over 300 more are proposed. Most reactors currently planned are in Asia, with fast-growing economies and rapidly-rising electricity demand.

&amp;#x200B;

Major uranium miners are seeing a demand increase in Uranium out to 2024 - and are subsequently significantly increasing production, including Camerco

Many western governments have started initiatives to support nuclear initiatives

Last quarter financial results showed negative earnings because they wrote off the expanse of restarting a mine. They previously shut the mine off due to poor uranium market performance.

Their main competitor is also increasing uranium production. They are both doing so based on contracts they’ve obtained and plan to obtain - neither seem to participate in the spot market in a material way.

&amp;#x200B;

Technically speaking, $CCJ has begun trying to break out of a major downtrend going back to 2014.

$CCJ Reiterated multiple times that they see strong profit going forward, and see production along with spot rates increasing. Given this, the Russian - Saudi oil regime, China's emergence as the nuclear energy super power, a massive reversal in short-term power plant decomissioning, the global incentive to go nuclear (Low long term cost, removal of complete reliance on oil, 'going green'), and  the material fact that Western governments have begun to spend money supporting this thesis...

&amp;#x200B;

Do you guys have any thoughts?

&amp;#x200B;

I'll leave with a headline I found:

Article dated: 6 Oct 2022

# No nuclear power ‘renaissance’ as Europe wrestles energy crisis

""...But after eight months of fighting in Ukraine, and an energy crisis compounded most recently by the alleged sabotage of the arterial Nord Stream 1 and 2 Russia-to-Europe pipelines in the Baltic Sea, European governments long opposed to nuclear power have shown only incremental shifts in their attitudes, which have been informed by years of concerns about nuclear waste and safety.

&amp;#x200B;

A wider pivot has remained absent.

&amp;#x200B;

“We’re not talking about a nuclear renaissance, as such,” Nicolas Berghmans, an energy and climate expert at the France-based Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations (IDDRI), told Al Jazeera, “but maybe more of a change of tide.”

&amp;#x200B;

“A real nuclear renaissance would be if Europe decides to invest in more nuclear power plants.”""",0.76,6,0,6,dd,2022-11-02T10:50:05Z,yjzuta,t3

Just a quick edit: [M2 Money Stock over the last 60 years](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL)

u/Infamous_Sympathy_91 's [post on credit card debt and personal savings from earlier today](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yjowp1/us_personal_savings_near_historic_lows/)


In 2020 money stopped moving. I wrote this in some of my previous posts and comments. In order to prop up economic activity, central banks increased money supply with almost 0 interest a.k.a Brrrrrr.

So ideally fresh minted money is distributed in the real economy and moves up and trickles down and so forth. As you can see in the chart above, money hasn't been moving as much in the economy since the peak in 2000; It's in constant decline with a hard fall in 2020.

Today central banks are trying to battle inflation. As you can see in the chart above, money isn't moving as much, so it's not that there is too much money in the real economy. Whatever they printed in the last 2 years went up to the big black void of finance. All the derivatives market, swaps, trenches and all sorts of made up bullshit has sucked up money faster than your wife sucking her boyfriend's cock.

Inflation is a product of price gauging and artificial crises, such as cutting down oil production, slowing down logistics around the globe, lagging or harsh response to the pandemic by governments etc.

What you're seeing with the interest rate increases will only hit small businesses and working people. Casino always wins. Banks will own everything. You will own nothing at the end of this.

In the next two years, you will lose your jobs, you will lose your homes if you have debt. You will start selling your assets until capitalism owns your ass. We had reached a point of multi-generational wealth with too many high net worth individuals. Those who are pulling the strings are actively sabotaging the economy and are robbing you.

The interest rates will once again go down, when most people lose everything and you can't borrow anymore. This isn't about bringing the inflation down by decreasing money spent in real economy. The chart in the link clearly shows you that there is no increased activity which would increase velocity of money.

So tomorrow or in the next year don't get your hopes up too much. Your average working class ape is in more debt than before and savings are at an all time low. The latest surge in house prices also guaranteed that banks and through them the central banks owns you.

This is the final stage of capitalism. Good luck to you all.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%. (Stats as of 2022-10-28)",0.8,12,0,12,dd,2022-11-02T03:10:54Z,yjr9oh,t3

So you like to make money fast? Is your motto Lambo or food stamps? This it’s for you. At 2 PM ET FOMC announcement made. A large price movement occurs at this time , this movement creates a fair gap value , as Powell starts to speak at 2:30 ET a counter move starts to test price movement created at release of hike announcement occurs. This can easily 2x-4x your 0 dte SPY option if it goes well if it doesn’t you lose 100% of your initial gamble I mean investment. This same pattern has occurred for the last two years . It doesn’t guarantee that it will happen again. Risky scalp with large potential for profit/losses. Just to reiterate if price has a large move up at 2 pm ET than just before 2:30 ET buy puts, if price has a large move down at 2 pm ET than just before 2:30 ET buy calls . This strategy has become rather popular in discord channels/twitter. No positions at the moment as strategy needs to be executed at FOMC.",0.62,3,0,3,dd,2022-11-02T01:46:07Z,yjpc8o,t3

13,wallstreetbets,DaddyDersch,self.wallstreetbets,48,"11-1-22 SPY/ ES Futures, Apple and Tesla Daily TA","It was the night before FOMC and all through the markets there was oddities… I had mentioned last night actually in my TA that I expect at some point markets were going to get shocked by a big drop intraday instead of this recovery rip… that day was today. 

The interesting thing about today is that VOLD (volume) actually came in bullish at open and through the whole day pretty much until right before power hour VOLD was actually in extreme bull momentum. Now SPY could not break out and break away from 385 level. The thoughts are we either watched markets be held up by volume or there was just some weird stuff going on today. There was some dark pool prints hitting the tapes again today. 

The other interesting thing that I noted today is that this is the first time that the day before FOMC the VIX has been red (and especially didn’t spike) since the June FOMCs. The last two FOMCs were the first with a spike of the VIX the day before. 

What does that mean ? well im not quite sure but those months of FOMC were more bullish. 

&amp;#x200B;

We also have quite a few articles released today saying that Biden supports a pivot of the fed (this was later slightly walked back though). 

My initial thoughts on what to expect tomorrow is that JPOW drops a 75bps (I would be SHOCKED to see a 50bps) but then he should hint at a “we will remain data dependent but there is a case to slow hikes if we continue to see optimism and to fully evaluate the effects of rate hikes.” 

But tomorrow will be interesting to say the least!

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ig9cg0t6hex91.png?width=773&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=358cc3b9af8b4e8c28541c1fa6b63f0f176b3cad

This TA is going to be pretty brief as markets gonna move however the algos want it to with FOMC. 

But overall we did attempt to breakout over 390.1 resistance of the green channel. With that pretty stout rejection we are not finding support which we did find almost all day at 385. This could if we get a green day tomorrow also be seen as a nice daily 8ema/ 50ema support test. In addition I am seeing that the 8ema is crossing back over the 50ema (bullishly) for the first time in two months. 

The rejection at 390.1 also was a rejection of the daily 100ema which im not super surprised by as this level is usually a bigger fight. Markets will need the push from good FOMC news tomorrow to break through these key levels and breakout until CPI. 

Key support- 380.1 -&gt; 377.8 -&gt; 374.1

Key resistance- 388.6 -&gt; 390.1 -&gt; 393 -&gt; 397.8 (my potential target for a bullish FOMC)

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at futures we have actually had this pattern play out just last week where we found support and managed to push up for an extreme green day. 

With a rejection of that 200ema today and that 3925 level that will remain key resistance and we will look for that level to be closed over tomorrow to continue to be bullish. 

Key support- 3845 -&gt; 3800

Key resistance- 3885 -&gt; 3925 -&gt; 3975

Apple has nearly retraced all the way back to where it was Friday before that massive rip on earnings. I wish I woulda been smart enough to short it Friday at market close. Apple was able to back test and hold the daily 8/50ema support lines today, however fell and closed under the 100/200ema. 

Key support- 148 -&gt; 146

Key resistance- 153.4 -&gt; 155.7 -&gt; 157.4

Tesla actually had a pretty nice pop today and broke through (but failed to close over) a key level. I was mentioning as you can see that 205 to 230 red channel on tesla. With this break through I am actually looking at an upside move on tesla (despite FOMC). 

This is its first time its broken through key 230 resistance since October 7th. We still have not closed over 230 though but as long as tesla holds over its daily 8ema and continues to hold this red bull channel I will remain bullish on it. 

Key support- 230 -&gt; 224.8 -&gt; 219.2

Key resistance- 234.2 -&gt; 239.6

&amp;#x200B;

As I had mentioned this is the first FOMC since June that the VIX has not popped significantly the day before. To me this means markets are bullish. I think that anything super hawkish for the FOMC tomorrow especially if he says 75bps in December the VIX is going to spike like no other and we could very well end up with a huge red day. However, I remain bullish and I think JPOW wont say anything to tip the markets down tomorrow. 

10% challenge-

Overall today was yet again another untradeable day after the first big move. Was able to get some nice scalps in today. And with an average down on my SPY and Tesla puts this morning at open I was able to close the SPY level to level puts for green and close the Tesla level to level puts for a smaller loss (they were very red at open). I don’t like DCAing to win a play like that but I didn’t expect that massive pre-market and with SPY holding under and beginning to dump off the key 390.1 resistance at open I felt confident in the DCA.

TLDR for my fellow apes:

\- A scientist started mapping multiple countries' claimed economic growth numbers to the increase in city lights seen from satellites

\- He found a high correlation between the two in democratic countries that had a free press and independent parties measuring the numbers

\- He found a large discrepancy between the two in autocratic regimes that controlled the reporting agencies and the press (shocker!)

\- Tested his theory against reasons why totalitarian countries might have fewer lights when experiencing massive economic growth (hey! they like working and living in the dark! They're allergic to electricity! They care more about the environment!). Nothing seemed to stand up to scrutiny.

\- Based on the growth in lights, he estimates that China's growth was less than half what they claimed. This means that China's GDP is likely less than half of the US rather than nearly equal

\- The other side of the coin is that their total debt levels might be between 600-700% of GDP rather than 300%

\- Paper has been peer-reviewed and presented at multiple economic conferences

I know it's pretty mind-blowing to think China might actually lie about something like this given their honest and transparent dealings to date but you have to admit the science is pretty spiffy.",0.87,389,0,389,news,2022-11-01T22:09:25Z,yjjsm5,t3

TLDR- we could go higher but we have more uncertainty in the near future as opposed to the last 2 weeks.

Some important dates to keep in mind:

Nov. 2nd- FOMC day

Nov. 10th- Oct. CPI data

Cant post the chart cus VisualMod keeps on taking it down.

Simple as seeing the last bear market rally and then applying it to now. We saw a rising wedge form on the monthly chart which is happening now. If the fed says it will indeed be ""kinder and gentler"" in any way shape or form you better bet your bottom dollar we will go to 408. However, on the off chance, the Fed says it will continue to bring more pain all your calls will be worthless in a few days. Now keep in mind that Oct. CPI will also determine if we continue to keep going higher even after a Fed ""pivot"". If CPI comes in hot we could see a similar drop back down to 350.

My plan- Wait till FOMC to see if the fed is indeed going to be kinder and gentler. If so buy $400 calls then take out my initial before CPI and if CPI is hot buy $360 puts.",0.65,8,0,8,dd,2022-11-01T21:44:03Z,yjj173,t3

**price\_efficiency:** how much are you losing to the bid/ask spread? Higher number the better. 

**expected\_move:** this is a percentage of the expected move, as priced by the ATM calls and puts, for this stock by expiration date (this Friday)

How to use this in your trading? 

Do you think **DASH** will move more than 14% by Friday? If not, sell options. If you think it will move for than that, I guess you might want to go long (debit) an option (not recommended). 

Do you want to trade **INTC**? Notice how the put\_IV is double that of calls. That means traders are bidding up the puts, and bidding down the calls relative to each other. If you think its going up, sell those puts and buy the calls. 

Want to trade **SBUX**? Realize that you will lose roughly 2% immediately when filling your trade and another 2% immediately when you exit. This is how the bid/ask spread works.

* The comments do not necessarily signal any pending actions against TikTok.
* The Treasury and Justice Departments are the ones leading a review and negotiations with the company.

Shares of U.S. social media companies Snap and Meta spiked on the news that a Federal Communications Commissioner said the U.S. government should ban TikTok.

“I don’t believe there is a path forward for anything other than a ban,” Republican Commissioner Brendan Carr told Axios in an interview.

Snap shares were up 6% and Meta shares were up 4% Tuesday afternoon.

The comments from Carr, one of four current commissioners at the Democrat-led agency, do not necessarily signal any pending actions against TikTok.

The Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS) in the Treasury Department is reviewing the company’s potential national security implications, given its ownership by a Chinese company, ByteDance. And the Department of Justice is the one leading negotiations over a security deal, The New York Times reported in September.

Concerns over TikTok’s potential security risks are generally bipartisan. Both the Trump and Biden administrations have expressed concerns and reviewed the company’s relationship with its Chinese owner. TikTok has maintained that it stores U.S. user data outside of China so that it would not have to turn over that information to the government, but U.S. officials have maintained their skepticism.

“Commissioner Carr has no role in the confidential discussions with the U.S. government related to TikTok and appears to be expressing views independent of his role as an FCC commissioner,” a TikTok spokesperson said a statement.

80,wallstreetbets,predictany007,self.wallstreetbets,38,President Biden to float windfall tax on U.S. energy producers. Do you think it will affect energy stocks?," 

* Shares of refiners, oil producers drop after news report
* AP reported windfall tax is being considered by White House

President Joe Biden will call on Congress to consider tax penalties for oil and gas companies accruing record profits, according to a White House official, amid stubbornly high gasoline prices that are dragging on Democrats’ midterm prospects.

This could include a so-called windfall profit tax -- which Democrats have been proposing for more than a decade without success. The idea has renewed attention among progressives in Congress after gasoline prices spiked to more than $5 a gallon this summer.

Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat and Biden ally who chairs the tax-writing Finance Committee, has floated a proposal that would impose a new federal surtax on oil companies that record a profit margin better than 10%.

The White House official didn’t confirm that Biden would specifically call for the windfall tax after AP reported earlier Monday that he would. Biden will press oil and gas companies to invest their profits in lowering costs for Americans, the official said.

The president is scheduled to deliver remarks Monday afternoon, according to the White House, on “reports over recent days of major oil companies making record-setting profits even as they refuse to help lower prices at the pump for the American people.”

Biden also could reiterate his request for Congress to eliminate a slew of tax incentives enjoyed by the industry, including a deduction of intangible drilling costs, which allows oil and gas companies to immediately deduct some expenses, such as labor, site preparation and repairs.

Administration officials have weighed a number of other steps to encourage oil refiners to keep more gasoline and diesel inside the US, instead of exporting it, as domestic stockpiles shrink ahead of winter. New restrictions on the export of finished fuels, including diesel, could be imposed administratively.

Oil industry trade groups have argued a windfall tax would penalize domestic energy and fuel production right when the US should be encouraging more of both.

“Rather than taking credit for price declines and shifting blame for price increases, the Biden administration should get serious about addressing the supply and demand imbalance that has caused higher gas prices and created long-term energy challenges,” American Petroleum Institute President and Chief Executive Officer Mike Sommers said in a statement.

“Today, the president is proposing to raise taxes on the U.S. natural gas and oil industry that is competing globally to produce the fuels Americans need every single day.”

The S&amp;P 500 Energy Index initially erased a 2% gain after the news broke but partially recovered trading up 0.9% at 2:04 p.m. in New York. Refining stocks led the declines.

The Biden proposal resembles measures that politicians across Europe, and in some other countries such as India, are imposing on companies reaping record profits from fossil fuels and power generation. Mostly, those governments are using cash raised from windfall taxes to help subsidize soaring energy bills for households.

Critics of such plans say they’ll deter companies from making the kind of investments that are crucial for increasing supply, and keeping prices down, in the future -- a charge that may have more traction in the US, which unlike most European countries is itself a major oil and gas producer.

OFC DYOR and I'd love if someone without bent bananas like me could figure this one out with more wrinkle details x  


p.s. anybody who can correct me on the title I shall edit it! If I can edit it, not a power user over here ;)

Like come on, 100M market cap for a company that has already recovered 500m of revenue and seems to be likely to survive?  


The hilarious thing is,. even after Cineworld pulled out bc of pandemic stuff, Cineplex is back trying to buy the US side of the market. If anyone knows cineworld has value, it's gotta be Cineplex - though they are for sure just trying to get cheap assets from a struggling Cineworld

According to the SEC’s order, Compass repeatedly assured investors in 2017 that a technology upgrade at its Goderich mine – the world’s largest underground salt mine which is located near Ontario, Canada, and hailed by the company as its crown jewel – was on track to materially reduce costs and boost its operating results starting in 2018. **Compass’s statements were misleading because they failed to tell investors that costs at the mine were increasing rather than decreasing, which substantially undermined the projected savings.** The SEC also found that Compass misled investors by overstating the amount of salt it was able to produce at Goderich.

The SEC’s order found that Compass violated the antifraud, reporting, and internal controls provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and various related rules.

In particular, Microsoft (MSFT) is down 7.72%, Alphabet (GOOGL) is down 9.63% and Meta (META) suffers a brutal 24.56% drop following the latest earnings. Instead, there are some old companies more than 100 years old that are worth looking at as investors are looking for opportunities in quality “old” companies.

## 1. [EQT Corporation (EQT)](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NYSE-EQT/)

EQT which was founded in 1888, is one of the oldest stocks. The majority of analysts (77%) are bullish on the energy company, and they expect the stock to rally 56% from there. Analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a report last month that ETO-Top's risk-reward setup was the ""best"" among its peers heading into the winter this year.

As Europe’s gas price skyrocketing for the year and oil price globally has risen substantially this year due to the war in Russia and Ukraine providing tight supply. Europe could be headed for tough winters for the next 10 years and the supply shortages are likely the keep natural gas prices on a volatile upswing. The EQT should be benefited from tight supply and strong demand from Europe.

## 2. [General Motors (GM)](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NYSE-GM/)

General Motors was founded in 1908 and has a buy rating from 62.5% of analysts. At the current price, the stock is expected to rise 25.7%. General Motors comfortably beat earnings expectations last week, but revenue was slightly below expectations and it maintained its full-year outlook. Either way, GM reported profits a full 20 percent higher than expected, triggering the rally in GM shares. The stock rose 3.6% on earnings day and is up 6.8% in the three trading days since the results were released.

In particular, the company's ""adjusted automotive free cash flow"" in the quarter, after excluding capital expenditures and adding royalties, went from a negative $4.4 billion a year ago to an impressive positive $4.6 billion this year.

TDLR: this pump was fueled by Japanese QE, White House is increasing inflation along with Japanese. Fed will be more aggressive to win, we all know the fed don’t lose




so everyone n their mother thinks we’re up because “pivot rumors” reality is when the pivot news dropped, market went green for a few minutes then shat the bed and ran red. then a certain something happened that made us run green and started this rally. It was BOJ interventions. BOJ (bank of Japan) dumped a whopping 40-50 billion dollars that morning so they can save the collapsing yen. Granted they were and partially still in denial about the whole interference as far as I can tell but they do assure y’all that they are “monitoring the markets” and they balance sheet keeps shrinking at a rather rapid pace.

So far off my estimates (too lazy to go pull up balance sheet) but I believe it’s around 200 billion that they have dumped into the markets since “bottom” was in. to put this into perspective, QT is burning slightly under 100bil a month and these guys just wiped out 2 months worth of hard effort and pain that the fed was trying to inflict in around 3 weeks time.

And there’s no sign of them stopping….. 

Their balance sheet is slightly over a trillion so they can keep this going on for a while.


THE CONSPIRACY

This whole operation along with “pivot” rumors are all well too damn coordinated. First off, we won’t see a pivot, CORE cpi was flaming hotter than Japanese pornstars. core PCE while came under estimates; it is still rising and there’s no sign of slowdown. So ask me again, why would they pivot or even hint at a pivot? 
It’s well known the White House has been begging Powell to go easy this meeting because of the election and u bet Powell is not being swayed. If politics were to get involved Powell is a republican and he’s on his last term so if anything he’s delivering more pain. But we all know Powell is here for the American people so I think he’s just gonna do what he had already planned and that is to just do his job and crush inflation. This is his chance to go down in history like Volker did. So I think the White House likley phoned the Japanese and begged them to dump dollars or someshit idk but this was all too well coordinated of a pump. The treasury(White House) is issuing an extra 150bil in debt above estimates. They are all adding to inflation trying to counteract the fed ahead of the elections.


this is why even if Powell had 75bps planned he will be forced to go with 100bps. They can’t increase QT since it’s really very close to max in terms of liquidity drain vs bank reserves. leaving the only option as more aggressive hikes to fight off the democrats and Japanese coordinated attacks against the fed. 


I think even with 100bps it’ll take some time to bleed the Japanese dry if they keep fighting so we can go on for months green if BOJ is willing to drop all 1 trillion that it has but I’m pretty certain they’ll stop once the election ends cuz it is coordinated after all to just spoof the markets for better votes in favor of the democrats",0.75,36,0,36,question,2022-11-01T13:37:05Z,yj6djm,t3

There’s one inflation gauge that bucks the trend

The New York Fed’s often overlooked UIG believes US inflation is past its peak


Whenever there’s an economic consensus on anything, it’s worth considering how it might be wrong. There seems to be general agreement that inflation and rates will be higher for longer, and “team transitory” has been defeated. But what if we are at an inflection point on inflation? This is the question policymakers should be asking. By one key measure, inflation in the US has already peaked. In fact, it peaked in March, the same month that the Federal Reserve began raising the benchmark rate.

The New York Fed’s underlying inflation gauge has largely been ignored for decades. That’s understandable, and not just because of the snoozer of a name. There wasn’t any significant underlying inflation in the years after the global financial crisis. While the Fed and financial markets are fixated on the 2 per cent inflation target, the UIG isn’t primarily a level forecast. Its real value is in predicting inflection points. It correctly anticipated the lasting high inflation we are now observing. And while it’s still high, the UIG is suggesting it will be abating.

The media and the public are obsessed with the consumer price index, while the Fed’s target is based on the personal consumption expenditures index. Both can be “noisy”, since they include the prices of volatile items such as energy and food. But they are not the only price measures. The Atlanta Fed tracks nine other indices(opens a new window) for inflation that aim to strip out noise. They show inflation somewhere between 4.7 and 7.3 per cent in September.

Most of these gauges remove data to try to identify underlying inflation. Core CPI excludes energy and food costs, for example, while trimmed mean and median measures strip out components with the largest changes in prices to smooth out the index. But the risk with these indices is that they can miss large price moves — up or down — that could be a signal of inflation changing direction.

The UIG is constructed differently, removing noise rather than items from the index. The idea is that movements in trend inflation happen alongside related changes in the trends of other economic and financial factors. The index looks at moves in prices, the labour market, financial markets and the real economy every month and checks the historical data going back to 1995 to see if similar moves had previously lasted at least a year. If so, they are included in that month’s UIG and if not, they are filtered out as noise.

You really can’t use the UIG to forecast the level of inflation, as has sometimes been suggested(opens a new window). Where it matters is in showing when the inflation trend is changing, and on this it has a decent track record in both normal and unprecedented times. When CPI hit a peak in 2018, for example, UIG clearly showed the peak while core CPI and trimmed mean and median indices suggested inflation would continue rising. In mid-2009, UIG showed a trough in inflation while the other measures took another year to reach a nadir.
What about during the pandemic? Core CPI did a good job of signalling a bottom for inflation in mid-2020 before rising, but dipped in the third quarter last year, wrongly suggesting that inflation would come down. The trimmed mean and median inflation indices failed to indicate a shift towards higher inflation, showing a trough more than six months after CPI and core CPI.

UIG found a bottom roughly in line with headline CPI and then started a steady climb upwards, rightly ignoring the slump in the third quarter of 2021. Of these metrics, it provided the earliest and most reliable signal for a rise in underlying inflation.

The Fed is now looking for signs that trend inflation has peaked and that monetary tightening is bringing inflation back towards its target. Much to its alarm, core inflation dipped in the second quarter of this year before accelerating in August and September. Median and trimmed mean inflation have been on a steady upward climb, with no signs of stabilisation. But the UIG peaked in March 2022, stabilised at high levels and has been gradually falling since July.

All the different gauges for inflation suggest it is way above the Fed’s target. But we know monetary policy works with long and variable lags, and there is a danger overtightening could spark a recession. The central bank aims to look through transitory factors and set policy based on the underlying trend. The UIG shows the trend is finally starting to reverse course. With rates now restrictive, that suggests it’s time for Fed officials to consider slowing their tightening path.

Always growing with over 170 consumer health brands. 

**The top 2 challenges  and why they are going in favour of Bayer** 

**1) litgations 2) europe economy**

**European economy and the rise of the germans** 

**The dark winter**
- we all know European is heading into a difficult winter, although energy prices have gone down since i write this, it is no guarantee they will remain so. However, the germans are going to spend there way out of this winter and are poised to avoid a recession in 2023.

*it has already begun*

Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase. 



1) winter recession avoided 

https://m.ca.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/germany-dodges-recession-but-inflation-climbs-to-116-2811016

Why will it benefit the underlying stock? 

Spending - stocks go up in spending times bud. 

2) surprising growth,  will it be enough to outpace inflation ?  For 2023  Germany is likely to be okay, and Bayers product are essentials, during hard times Bayer makes money as well.

https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/short_news/germany-under-fire-for-canibalistic-e200-billion-investment/

3) relief plan makes  the EU  worried, if Germany avoid recession by spending, other European nations will want to follow the idea,  inflation cannot be controlled like this. EU therefore sounds the alarm and potential consequences, it is likely that not too many nations will follow suit in my opinion , Germany can afford to be spending, not many  European nations can, making Germany the exception, in fact if Germany being the biggest economy in Europe  makes it through, much of Europe will also make I through. 

The worried citi suggest the following 

*The proposals could cut 2 percentage points off inflation in the next year, according to Citi, but they are unlikely to prevent an economic contraction. The package “may soften the coming recession but also poses risks, in our view,” Citi analysts said in a note released last Friday.*

Why are we using words like economic contraction  all of a sudden instead of recession? 

https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/07/germany-relief-plan-could-trigger-uk-style-bond-meltdown.html
- **The litigations over roundup** and *glysophate*


 Bayer is still facing litigations due to the acquisition of Monsanto and RoundUp and during the last earnings call, Werner Baumann gave updated numbers. There are about 141,000 claims in total and about 108,000 have been settled.

Remember they have already set the cash aside, have won or litigated the majority of all cases. The rest are likely to head the same path.

Here is glysophate  surging 300% in 2021 https://www.agweb.com/news/crops/crop-production/glyphosate-prices-soar-much-300-and-thats-if-you-can-even-get-it

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king: 

Take a look at some of these charts in the past 59 years  have crop production globally  ever decreased over time ? Never, ever.

With crop production increasing, it drags along with it:  Crop Science

lawsuit:
Counter point and what investors should know :


For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic. This includes recent conclusions by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the EU’s Assessment Group on Glyphosate (AGG), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), and the leading health authorities in Germany, Australia, Korea, Canada, New Zealand, and Japan.

https://www.bayer.com/en/roundup-litigation-five-point-plan

One of Bayer's core defenses in the litigation is that the EPA has decided glyphosate is not carcinogenic and not a risk to public health.",0.8,8,0,8,dd,2022-11-01T03:00:59Z,yiuf5p,t3
41,wallstreetbets,illikwid,self.wallstreetbets,25,How to trade 0dte options on FOMC Wednesday - A Regard's Perspective,"PHASE 0: 9:30-1:59:59

&amp;#x200B;

trading rangebound af.  0dtes swinging +/-10% on pure delta.  theta is frozen.  buy puts on your preferred index/etf at any time.  depending on your risk tolerance and the underlying, open a limit sell order for 1.5x-3x.  pussy with spy itms? get ur +50%.  lunatic on some otm spx? go for that +200% in 5 minutes u fucking god.

&amp;#x200B;

PHASE 1: 2:00:00-2:05 

 

i dont even wanna talk about what to do if its not 75bps but just in case...

100bps: do some sick euphoric dance and start howling.  then remember u set a limit order and lose your mind as you watch your 1.5x turn into free millionaire tickets.

50bps: cry and hope jpow starts levitating and speaking in tongues.  or maybe ur a maniac with a 4100 spx call hedge in case jpow starts handing out bags of cash instead of having a press conference.

&amp;#x200B;

75bps:

instant sentiment analysis on fomc statement finds ""pivot language"" to be largely absent.  spy down 1% in seconds, maybe making it all the way to -2%. your low-return sell order goes off in 10 seconds.  you clench and maybe walk around in a circle for 5 minutes.  your longer shots sell.

&amp;#x200B;

PHASE 2: 2:05-2:33  

&amp;#x200B;

conflicting narratives enter the picture.  the gamma recedes.  hopefully you're back in cash.  maybe you're in shambles cuz ur greedy limit just had its balls tickled.  we catch our breath and say, 'hold on, lets see what pow pows gonna say.  why are we down?  it was 75bps like everyone predicted.  that was priced in.  that was an overreaction, grab up this discounted shit quick.'  

market churns and claws back some to all of phase 1 losses.  pow pow takes his sweet ass time walking up to the podium and clears his throat...

&amp;#x200B;

PHASE 3: 2:34-2:4X

&amp;#x200B;

i dont know really. probably not much happens.  powell on his prepared remarks.  maybe he throws a hawkish jab or two, or sprinkles some grass for the bulls. hold on to ur cash.

&amp;#x200B;

PHASE 4: 2:4X-EOD

&amp;#x200B;

this is where we set momentum into jobs on friday.  powell opens some q+a.  first q probably some random bullshit that pow pow deflects heroically.  then maybe another softball, maybe a few more.  then some legendary lunatic reporter grabs the mic and says, 'YO JEROME YOU FUCKING PIVOTING OR WHAT?' powell takes a moment to collect himself, then states with volume and conviction we shall not pivot.  

now we're at another crossroads.  i'd say market starts selling right the fuck off.  but maybe, just maybe, we irrational bastards are so impressed by jpows stalwart leadership that we collectively decide an economy helmed by such a man must be infallible and head off towards the moon.

you could be in position before this pivotal (fuck you) line of questioning, hoping to predict the market reaction or do a spread if ur into that shit.  or you could wait a few minutes after jpow drops the mic for the direction to become clear and jump on it.  we're not changing direction til mid thursday at the earliest.  i wouldnt even call you a pussy if you bought a thurs / fri exp instead at this point and sold it late on thurs.  if you go with a 0 day roll that shit sometime 3:30-EOD.  

at least 3 percent up or down close on wed and an additional 1-3% move in the same direction on thursday.  

&amp;#x200B;

thats it.  if you made it this far, congratulations! for even considering trading on this perspective, you are now a more degenerate member of society.  even if we strike it big, we're gonna lose it soon or spend it on food accented with gold flakes, caviar, and our own tears.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%. (Stats as of 2022-10-28)",0.86,19,0,19,dd,2022-11-01T02:09:57Z,yitajz,t3

I have lost a lot like a lot of hard earned money in the past couple months. Last week, all I had left was $600, and I was looking on Friday Oct 28th at a Spy call (everyone was saying puts puts) but I just saw it and i was like this call this is it. But cause of all my past losses, I didn’t have the guts to press submit I just didn’t. And guess what, 2000% gains it went up 2000 frickin percent. I can’t believe I had it all was left just submit and at the end of day I could’ve gained 2000%. But I didn’t make it and I got even more scared cause I missed it cause I was scared. 

Anyway, today I was like I am not missing anything cause of fear, and I made two trades, both expired worthless so $600 is gone. 

I am sick of this. And it’s not like I just gamble. I calculate it and go for it, but I feel like the universe against me. Sometimes when I sell to break even it goes up later. And when I am like leave it let’s not just break even it will go up, no it goes down and down.

What a frightfully boring day today was… This honestly was one of the worst choppy range days I have seen in months. The total range for today on SPY was $3.14… usually we see that level of movement on the opening candle of SPY. 

The question remains where are we headed? 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you to u/80hz14 for posting this in the chat today… as you can see we have a few possible scenarios and outcomes for Wednesdays FOMC meeting. Overall I would say I am in the 75bps hike and a dovish presser where jpow hints at a 50bps in December. I think we should see a 3%+ green day on Wednesday. I would be pretty shocked with rising inflation to see JPOW drop a 50bps but honestly it could happen for other reasons. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today we saw an extreme small range day (only 39% of the 10 day average) inside day that closed as a gravestone doji. With 388.6 remaining as resistance I will be looking for downside until SPY can break free and close over that resistance level. Today we did see that the 386/ 3880 level on futures was impressively strong support. Any time SPY came anywhere near that we would see a pretty impressive pop. 

Overnight and tomorrow those will be our clear “breakout/ down” levels. From there it depends on which way markets want take us. We very well could end up with an equally as annoying range day tomorrow. However, I wouldn’t be surprised to see a small pullback tomorrow down to the 380 range. The last few FOMCs the two days leading up to it have provided a small pullback. 

Key support- 385 -&gt; 380.1 -&gt; 378

Key resistance- 388.6 -&gt; 390.2 -&gt; 393

Futures also had an extremely choppy overnight and intraday today. However, its daily char is closing with a double top right at 3910 and just under the daily 100ema resistance of 3925. With holding that key support of 3770 all day today we will look to those two key levels tomorrow to guide us on what direction we are going to be headed tomorrow. 

Its not impossible to believe that markets could rally tomorrow with hopeful whispers of FOMC on Wednesday but the historical trend would point to slight downside (risk off) leading into FOMC.

Key support- 3870 -&gt; 3845 -&gt; 3800

Key resistance- 3925 -&gt; 3975

Not much of a surprise after that’s unbelievable Friday that Apple had we had a pretty nice pullback on Apple, although it looks more impressive than it actually was being that Apple only closed down 1.54%. 

Apple is at a key level right here fighting between the daily 200ema of 153.4 and the daily 100ema of 152.2. Historically when it comes to Apple interacting with the 200ema it is a fight that lasts for a few trading days as the daily 200ema on Apple is a major major pivot point. I have not seen too many times where it takes a straight trend line down or up over the daily 200ema. 

Key support- 151 -&gt; 148

Key resistance- 153.4 -&gt; 155.8 -&gt; 157.4

&amp;#x200B;

Tesla remains a tricky one to get a good read on, however, as you can see we are maintaining a pretty consistent red sideways consolidation channel from 205 to 230. We have now see our 4th day in a row of Tesla rejecting the daily 20ema and refusing to close over it. However, this is now the 4th day in a row that it has closed over the daily 8ema. As you can see we are in a pretty impressive red bull channel here, however, that blue resistance and red support lines are forming a really nice rising wedge. 

Until Tesla can breakout and most importantly close over the daily 20ema I remain bearish on it. My anticipation would be that we see a move one way or another tomorrow. Key support for that red bull channel is 224.8 tomorrow which is also the 3 day support line and previous resistance line. While its not impossible I would be surprised to see Tesla hold between 230 resistance 224.8 support. 

Key support- 224.8 -&gt; 219.3

Key resistance- 230 -&gt; 234.2

You gotta love the VIX this thing just defies all logic. I am actually surprised with FOMC in two days to see the VIX unwind more like it did today, however, the VIX actually had a really impressive spike at open and closed down with a nice inside day… one of those odd days where the 10year yield, DXY and VIX were all red and SPY was red. 

Some of the issue I saw today was that over all price action, volume and momentum opened pretty bearish this morning, however, the VIX continued to unwind and I believe that led to a lot of this choppy tight range price action. The VIX is currently holding right at the same level it was prior to last FOMC where the day before fomc closed at a VIX of 27.15. 

Overall no real sense of direction for SPY tomorrow as until FOMC happens the market in my opinion is not going to play nicely and not play by the technicals. 

FOMC day is setting up to be a really nice day for some nice wins, I have posted that TA and trade plan/ analysis. Make sure you give it a read! 

10% challenge-

Today was a really tough day for me today. Actual scalp wise I did do fairly well today, however, I had my level to level calls from Friday that I should have closed the Tesla calls green this morning (regrets) and I actually ended up closing them pretty early this morning when pretty much everything pointed to downside… only for them to pop up right after I closed them. If it wasn’t for those two woulda been a decent day despite the hard price action. 

I also thing that’s something that is going to catch this market by surprise here very soon and possibly even tomorrow for pretty much the last week or two now the price action of SPY in the mornings has been pretty bearish and has also been support by volume too. However, by 11ish we have seen a complete snap of trend and 180 reversal… today just chopped instead of broke out. I wonder if we get a slight sell off tomorrow as people get caught thinking its time to buy the morning weakness. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bpvi8i5on7x91.png?width=883&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a2874c15f1667138319a8a6f0de51c94dc5841f

Closing out my most profitable month of the year and also one that I do not plan to attempt to beat. Great month with some great plays. Keeping in mind that my average % gain per trade was still only 12.7% for the month. This wasn’t so much about getting random massive winners… though I had some nice wins in there too… it was more about consistent small gains that have added up over time and most importantly limiting downside risk with a -20% stop loss. 

I posted my article about that this weekend but something to keep in mind is that just because I use a -20% stop loss on my scalps doesn’t mean that is right for you. You have to find what works for your strategy and your overall profits/ trade. The whole theory is though that you can have an extremely successful strategy but if one loser wipes out all of your weeks profits or numerous days of profits then you need to manage your risk better. It’s a balancing act of having a lose enough stop to not stop out too quickly (especially on my level to level plays) BUT not having such a big stop loss that it hits and the loss takes numerous trades to overcome. 

&amp;#x200B;

Mostly for my own records but I am going to starts separating my scalps and my level to level trades from eachother and this month of November I really wanna analyze the comparison of them and everything more closely.

92,wallstreetbets,predictany007,self.wallstreetbets,18,JPMorgan Says Dovish Fed Could Spark The S&amp;P 500 To Rally 10% In One Day.,"While hopes for a less aggressive Federal Reserve helped US stocks overcome last week’s flurry of disappointing earnings from tech giants, JPMorgan Chase &amp;. Co.’s trading desk now sees room for a massive rally should policy makers turn dovish when they announce their decision on Wednesday.

The S&amp;P 500 could surge at least 10% in one day if the central bank raises interest rates by a slower-than-expected half of a percentage point, and Chair Jerome Powell signals willingness at the press conference to tolerate elevated inflation and a tightening labor market, according to the bank’s sales team including Andrew Tyler. The scenario is the “least likely” to materialize, yet the “most bullish” outcome for equity investors, the team wrote in a note to clients on Monday.

Laying out every possible scenario on Fed day, the JPMorgan team is embarking on a high-stakes task of predicting market moves based on an event that has largely been positive for stocks this year. Of the six prior meetings, the S&amp;P 500 rose four times on Fed day and fell on the other two, according to Bloomberg data.

To be sure, the bank’s economists expect the Fed to boost rates by another three-quarters of a percentage point, in line with the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey, and Tyler’s team views other scenarios as less likely. Still, the exercise offers a lens into the risks that investors are grappling with.

“These outcomes are skewed to the upside as our view is that last week the market had every reason to retest lows given the disappointment from megacap tech earnings and still moved higher,” noted Tyler and his colleagues. “Several client conversations have focused on trying to identify who is the incremental seller; we think the risk/reward is to the upside.”

Below are the scenarios from the JPMorgan team on how the S&amp;P 500 could react on Fed day.

* 50 basis point hike, with a dovish press conference: “It is difficult to conceive of a scenario where this outcome occurs given inflation levels and a tight labor market,” the team wrote. “Should this outcome occur, the immediate reaction could produce a double-digit one-day return for equities.” S&amp;P 500 up 10% to 12%
* 50 basis point hike and a hawkish press conference: An outcome that could stem from a Fed that is increasingly concerned about financial stabilities as it balances growth and inflation. S&amp;P 500 up 4% to 5%
* 75 basis point hike and a dovish press conference: A scenario viewed as having the second-highest probability of playing out. “If you saw the Fed give explicit guidance for the December meeting, then that is likely viewed as a dovish outcome.” S&amp;P 500 up 2.5% to 3%
* 75 basis point hike and a hawkish press conference: “This is the most likely outcome with Powell retaining optionality for December and 2023 meetings while emphasizing the current risks to inflation moving higher.” The team also views this as the outcome most expected by bond markets, so says there may not be a significant move in yields that keeps equities from melting down. S&amp;P 500 down 1% to up 0.5%
* 100 basis point hike and a dovish press conference: While this is seen as unlikely as a 50 basis point hike, it may mean the Fed both wants a higher terminal rate and wants to complete the tightening cycle this year. “Separately, the market may digest this move as the Fed having prior knowledge of where next week’s CPI prints.” S&amp;P 500 down 4% to 5%
* 100 basis point hike and a hawkish press conference: Considered the best outcome for equity bears waiting for this latest rally to dissipate. “Here this would seem to be a Fed reassessing its own inflation forecasts, which some investors feel is too optimistic.” S&amp;P falls 6% to 8%, likely resting year-to-date lows.

Smith, Commissioner United States Securities and Exchange Commission before the American Bankers Association . . . , February 8, 1971 - when the NASDAQ began trading on February 8, 1971, as the world's first electronic stock market ""A Piece of Paper Revisited""","""What I want to discuss with you today is a piece of paper. It is nothing more than that, and yet it represents a great deal more. 

It is a piece of paper that vitally affects you and us and the entire financial community. It is also a piece of paper that despite being old and encrusted with a century or more of hoary legalisms has the most amazing, the most appalling reproductive capacity -- it procreates not merely subdivisions of itself but during the course of its life and travels generates an incredible number of relative pieces of paper, that cling to it, describe it, give it directions, authenticate it, transfer it, transform it, cancel it, encumber it. Like all relatives, these attachments are each very different and together very expensive.

The progenitor piece of paper to which I am referring, of course, is the stock certificate.""

\---

A lengthy read, that I'm too lazy to type it all out. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1971/020871smith.pdf)

Why did I come across this, some might ask? 

Well, I was trying to find out when stock market became electronic. Then I was wondering who programmed it.. 

Okay then, why am I curious about who programmed it?

I'm kindly regarded, hugely. But I still wonder things sometimes; If some of you are like me, and have been glued to these charts past 2'ish years - there's a kind of relative thing happening.. I can't quite describe it but as a uh, prolonged barrel-rolling sewing machine pattern, if that makes sense... and it's not 'making' something it's .. well, sort of seeding a landscape we're looking at from top-down..

Which got me to the wondering part, who was it that programmed the NASDAQ initially? 

6oo6ling that specific Q got me nothing so I broke down what I could possibly render a reasonable direction from: computer/software companies in the 60's

A few things stood out to me - IBM, Fortran, and [Harlan Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills) 

IBM because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then. 

"" In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than [4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1946%E2%80%931959:_Postwar_recovery,_rise_of_business_computing,_space_exploration,_the_Cold_War) were IBM machines. ""

&amp;#x200B;

[Fortran](https://emmachev.com/what-is-the-difference-between-pascal-and-fortran-programming-languages/) because it is a procedural, imperative, general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations. After IBM developed it in the 1950s, it soon gained popularity in programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then Harlan Mills. Just look at his timelines and titles. Specifically -  

* Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1975–81

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my thinking.. SEC knew then what we know now. Banks are assholes doing asshole stuff (if you read more of ""A Piece of Paper Revisted"" (see way above). And they figured, well, if we get rid of the human element (to some degree) this might make things more legit for more ppl than less of them. 

IBM is a huge, American computer company. Invest in America, it was the 50's/60's afterall. We were boomin' baby. And they have this Fortran language that handles all kinds of processes. Then we have Harlan Mills - I mean for all what was going on above... he has a suspiciously obvious time gap.. then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth.. pretty sus cuh.

&amp;#x200B;

All right, you've gotten this far in my rabbit hole. 

Along my tinfoil travels, I came across this other dude [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Early_years) \- he apparently influenced Harlan Mills - As an IBM research fellow, Mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development. These included automata theory, the structured programming theory of Edsger Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, and others, and Markov chain-driven software testing.

But what got me in Dijkstra's 'Legacy' section was the [Banker's alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) \- 

The Banker algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an ""s-state"" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

And this is when I came full circle on the part above I was trying to describe at ""I'm kindly regarded."" 

Anyway, this rabbit-hole kinda tripped me out. Figured a share.

A friend once said and i paraphrase ' The techs can not rise unless the semis get bullish 'i sure hope this is the beginning of the Rally to 4200-4500 we keep hearing about .i made a lot of money in semis the last three weeks but perhaps i took profits too early. A volatile lot to be sure and i don't own at present . If the broader market stays bullish i will buy back on a dip . Need to see strength from other techs first.   


i called this Q4 semi rally way back in early October and the Semis bottomed on October 13th . So i feel like the Semi sector now needs the rest of the tech market to participate in order for a post mid term rally to materialize .   


having said that, i think the market typically rallies 16% on the following 12 months post midterms so its a now or never event just in front of us.

I’m only a year old member of the page, but thought i’d share my thoughts because while this page is fun, it can also be toxic at times and not overly helpful or insightful. That being said, there are plenty of times I have seen positivity and  insight. I’m not a professional at this at all, but thought i’d share my thoughts after my first year of trading options…. But first here was my trade today:

I took a short position (bought puts) on TSLA towards the top of its 207-226 channel this morning. Took 2 contacts at 220ish. 1 additional contract at 223ish. I had my stop loss set, and then went to my actual job. The thesis was that it would get back to 207 support in short to mid term.


 I obviously got very lucky that TSLA severely underperformed today and happened to hit my target. I’ve always hung on to losers too long and winners too short, so i was sure to move my stop to break even when it moved my way, and then continually moved my stop up as the trade worked in my favor. Eventually got stopped out around 206 for $1,710. Felt nice because the risk reward was there, and everything made sense, obviously lucky that TSLA was weak with twitter debacle, but nice to have one go my way.


I’m now long two contracts as you can see above. Thesis is TSLA will return to 220s and stay within this channel in short to mid term. If i get stopped out monday, so be it, but the risk reward for me makes sense.


Things i’ve learned the last year: 


1. I can’t trade 0dte contracts. It’s straight gambling for me and i suck at that. I’m also too busy with my actual job to monitor trades like these which i assume require a high level of attention to detail. 3-4 Weeks minimum preferred for me.


2. The trade has to have a clear out front thesis that doesn’t evolve to fit your bias as the trade plays out.

3. Position sizing is so important for my financial and mental well being. I have to be sure to never risk more than a certain percentage of my portfolio. “Preserve precious capital” as a famous trader says makes sense to me


4. The better my mental and physical health the clearer my mind is with trading.


5. Mistakes happen. Basically blew up my account last fall when beginning options and while i hated myself, it taught me a lot about myself, and my tendencies.

6. I prefer to stick with one stock and listen to a few youtubers i like that analyze it. Simple things like supply and demand level, rsi and macd, and paying attention to fed news and the indices.

I’m not an OG here, but thought i’d share my thoughts and a positive trade i made as i continue to grow and improve. Maybe the mods will remove, idk. TGIF


TLDR: i have learned the hard way about risk management, having a real thesis before trades, and avoiding theta decay/ giving myself time on trades by picking better (in my opinion) expiration dates. Also, if i can’t sleep or feel anxious after the closing bell, i know i am not sizing properly and over risking …

# Risk Analysis - Statistical Analysis

Taking in count the stock's price movement from 2002 to 2022, we have the following data:

|Expected Minimum Return|0.16%|
|:-|:-|
|Variance|0.26%|
|Standard Deviation|5.07%|

Taking in count the stock's price movement from 1st December 2021 to Today, 5th November 2022, we have the following data: 4739

Statistically Speaking, investing in GME has a high probability to give you a return around -5 and 5%, with 43.46% of the data population between -5% and 0 and 45.94% between 0 and 5%.

This gives us a 10.60% chance to get an outlier return from the historical data.

Standard Deviation suggests a 13.11% to ride on a price movement higher than 5% or lower than -5%. In the long run the chance of getting outlier is reduced to 5%.

The FED has raised rates to 4%, we will factor in a 4.50% rate instead.

Risk Free Rate is 4.15%

# Final Comment

With its current amount of Cash &amp; Cash Equivalents and without any drastic changes in the company structure and business model, GME is expected to burn is cash within 35 Months. Taking in mind receivables and other liquidity, it still have 39 months remaining in operation.

The company can avoid this by taking more loans or selling parts of the company and other assets.

Company doesn't pass Acid Test, and it is in a dire financial struggle to survive.

Still expecting negative income and cash flow from operations for 2023.

Debt is not critical, this shall allows some room for a possible long term loan.

Current Cash can cover only 94% of current liabilities. The company should be able to cover it with receivables.

ROE, ROA, ROIC and ROC terrible.

ROE is in recover, so GG

ROIC worsen and ROA is stable

This suggest that, yes the management is trying to fix the company, with some positive outcome, but they are struggling a lot right now.

Income quality getting away from danger zone, but still in bad situations.

Gross profit margin worsened. Company cannot manage well costs, this is probably due to inflation and macro.

There are ""***Strategic and Operational Risks Related to Digital Asset Initiatives""*** *that can have huge positive impact as well as dire outcome if it fails. This is a huge risk factor.*

In the mid term, 1-2 years, the company shall gradually trade down from current price to $15 with possible spikes due to external factors. Expect (90% chance) movements between -5% and 5% cause historical price action with a 10% chance to cash in or go tits up.

Fundamentals point toward bankruptcy, but as for now, if the management play their card well there is a possibility to recover.

With current balance sheet, market  health and macro, the company is fucked up.

consider a stock that has experienced several highs and lows over the last year through both bullish and bearish trending patterns. A technical analyst using a Bollinger  channel may see that the price is approaching its support trendline. If the stock has a positive weighted alpha it can be an affirmation that the stock’s price has largely been gaining over the last year, **supporting another bulish push higher.**


**why is a European Germany company rising its revenue guidance when apparently Europe is gone to sh**t ? You will find out why it is my honest opinion that Warren buffets reasoning to buy when everyone fears is can be applied for Bayer**

The 2022, full year growth outlook raise  is significant, particularly in its crop science division;:

1. Now expecting a 10% previously 5% in the seed and crop protection market for 2022, driven high quality prices for seeds and crop commodities and inflation.

2. Pharmaceutical division to expand by 6% previously 5%

3.conhmsr health 5% from 4% 

**remember this is just by the end of 2022, if the conditions persist the growth outlook widens, it seems like  the basic needs or medication and crops are recession proof when picking the correct company**

**The top 2 challenges  and why they are going in favour of Bayer** 

**1) litgations 2) europe economy**

**European economy and the rise of the germans** 

**The dark winter**
- we all know European is heading into a difficult winter, although energy prices have gone down since i write this, it is no guarantee they will remain so. However, the germans are going to spend there way out of this winter and are poised to avoid a recession in 2023.

*it has already begun*

Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase. 



1) winter recession avoided 

https://m.ca.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/germany-dodges-recession-but-inflation-climbs-to-116-2811016

Why will it benefit the underlying stock? 

Spending - stocks go up in spending times bud. 

2) surprising growth,  will it be enough to outpace inflation ?  For 2023  Germany is likely to be okay, and Bayers product are essentials, during hard times Bayer makes money as well.

https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/short_news/germany-under-fire-for-canibalistic-e200-billion-investment/

3) relief plan makes  the EU  worried, if Germany avoid recession by spending, other European nations will want to follow the idea,  inflation cannot be controlled like this. EU therefore sounds the alarm and potential consequences, it is likely that not too many nations will follow suit in my opinion , Germany can afford to be spending, not many  European nations can, making Germany the exception, in fact if Germany being the biggest economy in Europe  makes it through, much of Europe will also make I through. 

The worried citi suggest the following 

*The proposals could cut 2 percentage points off inflation in the next year, according to Citi, but they are unlikely to prevent an economic contraction. The package “may soften the coming recession but also poses risks, in our view,” Citi analysts said in a note released last Friday.*

Why are we using words like economic contraction  all of a sudden instead of recession? 

https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/07/germany-relief-plan-could-trigger-uk-style-bond-meltdown.html
- **The litigations over roundup** and *glysophate*


 Bayer is still facing litigations due to the acquisition of Monsanto and RoundUp and during the last earnings call, Werner Baumann gave updated numbers. There are about 141,000 claims in total and about 108,000 have been settled.

Remember they have already set the cash aside, have won or litigated the majority of all cases. The rest are likely to head the same path.

Here is glysophate  surging 300% in 2021 https://www.agweb.com/news/crops/crop-production/glyphosate-prices-soar-much-300-and-thats-if-you-can-even-get-it

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king: 

Take a look at some of these charts in the past 59 years  have crop production globally  ever decreased over time ? Never, ever.

With crop production increasing, it drags along with it:  Crop Science 


BAYER AG  lifts forcast amid sustained boom in farming prices. crop science unit is major growth engine with price gain.

lawsuit:
Counter point and what investors should know :


For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic. This includes recent conclusions by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the EU’s Assessment Group on Glyphosate (AGG), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), and the leading health authorities in Germany, Australia, Korea, Canada, New Zealand, and Japan.

https://www.bayer.com/en/roundup-litigation-five-point-plan

One of Bayer's core defenses in the litigation is that the EPA has decided glyphosate is not carcinogenic and not a risk to public health.",0.99,9,0,9,question,2022-11-05T02:48:48Z,ymfmmn,t3

I read online that a Form 25 has to be filed with US securities regulator SEC within 60 days of the first issue of proxy soliciting materials for voting on matters related to the buyout. This form certifies that the stock will be delisted by the exchange upon completion of the merger.

On September 02, Zendesk published the first round of proxy soliciting materials. The deal was then approved by Zendesk shareholders during a meeting on September 19. The Form 25 was now most likely has already been filed around November 02.

The Form 25 won't be made available to the public or be ""considered valid"" unless Zendesk issues a press release indicating completion of the deal, and that the exchange has received evidence of a certificate of merger from Zendesk. Upon all conditions being satisfied, the exchange removes the listing 10 days after the Form 25 becomes public. In 90 days, the SEC nullifies the registration of the securities. If Zendesk were to go public in the future, it would be assigned a new CUSP ID.

When a stock gets delisted as a result of a company going private, options are cash settled for the difference between the buyout price and the strike price.

Given that deals tend to be completed within a week of the Form 25 being drafted and confidentially submitted to the SEC, are you guys willing to risk $5 to buy 77 dollar call options expiring 11/11/2022 in anticipation of the deal closing next week?

# TLDR

Zendesk is incorporated in Delaware according to SEC filings.

If the status changes to an L (consolidated), the transaction has went through.

[https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/Ecorp/EntitySearch/NameSearch.aspx](https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/Ecorp/EntitySearch/NameSearch.aspx)

Zendesk apparently has a charitable foundation, and  the status for their charitable organization will likely change from Exempt to M (Merged) one day early before Zendesk Inc changes their status from General to L (Consolidated) .

**FILE         NUMBER ENTITY NAME**

5606971  ZENDESK CHARITABLE FOUNDATION

4661237   ZENDESK, INC.

[https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/Ecorp/FieldDesc.aspx#ENTITY%20TYPE](https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/Ecorp/FieldDesc.aspx#ENTITY%20TYPE)

It apparently costs 20 dollars each time I want to refresh the status of the entity or to check their filing history :(

Changing the status of a company from General to Merged takes about 2-3 weeks apparently, or 24 hours if expedited services are requested.

After getting the certificate of merger between Zendesk Charitable and Zendesk Inc, the company needs to pursue a certificate of consolidation to create a new holding company. When all the documents are prepared, they are sent to the company through snail mail.

If you are checking the site for real time updates, clicking on the link of a consolidated company will likely cause you to be redirected to the original search page.

If you click on any one of the corporations and the unofficial certificate of good standing fails to load, the company's status has also been changed to consolidation. A potential merger arbitrage will be available since return mail does take at least 1 day.",0.99,5,0,5,question,2022-11-04T23:55:35Z,ymbn97,t3

One of the biggest intraday dumps and recoveries I have seen in a long time and also one of the first times ive seen it with the VIX at such a low level. 

Next week we have election midterms and we have CPI. I will this weekend or next week sometimes post my CPI trade plan to the server but for now here is my expectations for CPI next week after running the numbers. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/elizrxa930y91.png?width=484&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=523d615fe4c4afde022a1f70471e1cc3a5b4bae9

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/z3snoeo930y91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9017c5f75bba431e2e87901486bfadaa448c65b

Lets take a little more of a zoomed out look on the daily this time. What do we see? We see that we are still well within that green bear channel of 2022 and are holding right around that red dotted 50% retracement line. We have also formed over the last 2 months now a very sizeable black rising wedge that support was actually reconfirmed on today. We also held the red channel support of 370.6 extremely well today and rejected the 378 channel resistance all in one single day (which is impressive). Effectively we are stuck in this train and rising wedge until otherwise proven. 

Bull case for next week- bulls want to see a midterm election week rally and see a rally into CPI. First step is taking out that 378 resistance and establishing that as support. From there its time to take the red resistance line out from FOMC and look to retest the daily 100ema resistance around 388-390. 

Bear case for next week- with a looming CPI ahead and the FOMC pivot on the pivot this week bears will look to continue to reject 378 channel resistance and eventually break through and close under the 370.5 support and break the support of the black rising wedge. Once that is broken bears have opened the downside to re-test the 350 to 360 support area. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2bfkkd5a30y91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e512c7c006be622548dd43c6fd3a4df6d5346c99

On the weekly timeframe you can see we actually did break the rising wedge that is present from last week. However, we did come down and retest the weekly 200ema and confirmed that as support this week. With this candle body closing inside of last weeks bears and bulls both have an opportunity to break out next week and this could be the start of a bull flag if the bulls can defend 375.9 next week. 

Key support- 375.9 -&gt; 363.6 -&gt; 357

Key resistance- 390.2 -&gt; 408.6

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2jv8guqa30y91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b0221f5520ba291ee83d3caff612c9865da3810

Futures has a similar rising wedge formed with the downside resistance from FOMC. Overall a really nice double bottom and bullishly engulfing candle on futes daily that should provide some upside for Monday next week. Bulls need to retake that 3805 resistance next week early and bears will look to take out 3710 support early next week. Both of these remain key pivot points for futures. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/eufo1b8b30y91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5a7796d72bee08c5cf9213acc44204d9a54b92e

Futures (SPY too really) has a overall macro falling wedge with a blue bull channel that has a blue/ red rising wedge inside of it… yay TA! Overall this was a double top on the weekly at 3910, however, this could easily form into a 3775 double bottom come Sunday night at open and easily lead to an upside push next week. With the weekly 200ema being held once again we should look at upside not downside. 

Key support- 3775 -&gt; 3705 -&gt; 3590

Key resistance- 3910 -&gt; 4085

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gc2wolqb30y91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=60a77eadeef4c232598cc943d91664050aeb060d

Apple had one of the most interesting intradays I have seen on a non major catalysts day in a long time. Apple went all the day down to the October CPI LOD within one penny and someone still managed to rally back and close over 138.2. I actually REALLY would have liked to take apple calls with this closure back over key 138.2 support but it was EOD and too late plus I already had TESLA calls im swinging and SPY I opened instead. 

Apple will look to attempt to gap fill that 145 gap for the bulls and bears are going to attempt to close under 138.2 and put in a new 52 week low. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i9ifx6bc30y91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0cb54a497a1a26685abc6a65cae03b3bf8c0f2b6

The weekly show just how strong this 138.2 support is for Apple and why I was so ready to pull the trigger on calls but was too slow. You can also see that Apple did close back under its weekly 100ema and put In its biggest red week since March 2020 during the COVID crash. 

Key support – 138.2 -&gt; 133.3 -&gt; 129.1

Key resistance- 141.2 -&gt; 147.1 -&gt; 150.8

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5zuvm9uc30y91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b43a51e50533e8fc418a07d6c2c691cb3f289590

Tesla as I had mentioned continues to range in that 205.6 to 234 red channel. I had played some overnight calls on tesla for a huge 47.8% win at open on a 7dte and thankfully closed at open because wow did it get absolutely smacked down. Tesla put in a $20.72 drop from HOD to LOD which was 156% of its average 10day range. A pretty impressive range for Tesla that’s for sure. The biggest thing we have forming here on Tesla is that huge blue/ black diamond and we bounced hard one again off the 205.6 support range. I will be looking for an upside move next week on Tesla and remain bullish especially as long as we continue to hold 205.6 support. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/iztfevdd30y91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3775a029fe4ebe54c829bb59a9c5508c917f74b1

AS you can see on Tesla weekly chart we are still within that downward bear channel and did reject an attempt to breakout over the weekly 8ema. There is also a breakout triangle forming with key level of 224.2 and 207.8 for next week. 

Key supports- 204.4 -&gt; 192.1

Key resistance- 228.3 -&gt; 245

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/157xkwhe30y91.png?width=610&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad41f6767f0490a95c28e16704e60fc6bbd4cee0

We finally saw some volatility with the VIX today with a pretty large rebound spike when we had that huge 1115am dump. However, the vix remains in the downward channel and realistically until we see that resistance broken and see a major major bearish catalyst (cough CPI cough) I wouldn’t be shorting just yet. You COULD start adding slow longer DTE puts like 30-60 dte but I feel you are still early and are just wasting money. WE are also approaching that key 23.6 VIX support area and funny enough before the September CPI we actually were right at the 23.6 support area too. Perhaps we see a pretty bullish three days next week on the markets much like September leading into CPI and then CPI starts the next leg down headed into December. 

Overall I lean for a bullish Monday at least with a possible choppy Tuesday/ Wednesday as markets prepare for CPI but there is a very good chance we could see a pretty impressive green week next week and end up all the back up near 390 before CPI hits. The higher we are the bigger drop I believe CPI could potentially bring for us. 

Daily log- 

This was another amazing week for me. The week really did suck Monday and Tuesday and then after taking that bigger L on Wednesday I was able to recover today and end up finishing the week off going 11 for 11 today with 4 for 4 on scalps and 7 for 7 on level to level plays. Note- a lot of people are inquiring more about my level to level plays so this is something I will once again try to cover and I will make a post this weekend about it I hope. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jshjt4ze30y91.png?width=888&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fccc1c3e198a4ab59265a8fb834330bfc48e8ecd

Interestingly enough… this is now the 2nd week in a row where my level to level plays have netted a greater profit then my actual scalps. This is something I will continue to monitor as time goes forward and I will continue to adjust as time goes on. This week was also extremely tough to scalp as Monday and Tuesday were very untradeable and then Wednesday with the IV spiking was tougher to trade too for big gains. However, with this being the 2nd week in a row with these results I will continue to monitor and see going forward if this trend holds. But for anyone following me who struggles to get in on the scalps while obviously the win rate is no perfect on the L2L plays and never will be with the built in price target stop loss and take profit target (tho I regrettably always take profits early) the profits should greatly outweigh the losses. Definitely something to keep in mind going forward for me. 

Youtube will be up later!

I get we're all lazy but this shit is garbage implemented ONLY to give bankers and institutions an advantage. The government and bankers are essentially saying we're not worthy enough of being given access to our capital markets.

I’m new to wsb, I discussed my stocks more with friends but they all gave up on trading lol. I made big profits in the last years with Tesla and other tech stuff (about 500%). I was basically a buy and hold investor but started with options some months ago to leverage my portfolio. It did well but I’m less optimistic now. I think the next years will be though and shorting the Nasdaq 100 is still a good move now. But I’ll still hold Tesla and Apple. Maybe some other large caps too - It’s hard to let them go after all those years of profits.

The only thing I’m really optimistic right now is Porsche. It startet only about one month ago and the Porsche family is happily buying back as much stocks as possible. They set a very low price on the stock to buy it back very cheap. I think they secretly want to buy back everything to own it again like in the early 2000s. I’m not sure if they are genius or crazy… Anyway I also calculated a target price of 154€ per share in the short term and expect it much higher if they really want to buy it back. The fundamentals and future are amazing and I bought lots of lots of calls. Maybe some of you have also looked at P911 and wants to discuss it.

I’m happy to hear about your opinions :)",0.56,1,0,1,dd,2022-11-04T21:17:47Z,ym7pet,t3

7,wallstreetbets,caprazzi,self.wallstreetbets,6,Paramount (PARA) - The Cheapest Stock in the Market,"Just coming on to share the mind-bogglingly low valuation of Paramount (PARA). Consider the following:

1.) Paramount possesses the fastest growing streaming offering in the market, Paramount+.

2.) Paramount owns CBS and has the rights to broadcast most NFL games as well as Premier League Soccer.

3.) Paramount Pictures has had a wildly successful year, including the release of Top Gun Maverick, the 5th highest grossing film of all time. 

Despite this, PARA shares are trading at an embarrassingly low valuation:

1.) Price/earnings multiple of less than 8.

2.) Approximately one third price/sales.

3.) Less than half of book value.

Paramount is definitely a company in transition, but this valuation dislocation is borderline criminal. On top of this beautiful stock sundae, you get more than 6% in dividend yield just to hold the shares while you wait for the price to normalize, and the short interest is just under 15%.

22,wallstreetbets,ThreeD710,self.wallstreetbets,2,Effects of Inflationary Boom/Bust or Deflationary Boom/Bust on the businesses involved in Energy,"This is a abridged post and is a summary of the following four scenarios –

1. **Inflationary Boom** – increase in prices along with an increase in economic growth
2. **Inflationary Bust or Stagflation** – increase in prices along with a decrease in economic growth
3. **Deflationary Boom** – decrease in prices along with an increase in economic growth
4. **Deflationary Bust** – decrease in prices along with a decrease in economic growth

And how they affect –

1. **Demand for energy**
2. **Investments in energy**

These scenarios occur in varying frequency and sequence over short periods (about 5 years) of time, which combine to form a regime. A regime can either be inflationary (increasing prices) or deflationary (decreasing prices) and can last several decades. The last four decades have been deflationary, and the next four, **appear inflationary**.

**Why do the four scenarios matter**\*\*?\*\*

Because the change in prices and economic growth affect the rate of inflation, which in turn affects the interest rate, which affects how much money is in the economy. The amount of money in the economy affects commercial and retail borrowing and spending, leading to an increase/decrease in demand for goods and services. **An increase/decrease in the demand for goods and services leads to an increase/decrease in the demand for energy**.

&amp;#x200B;

**How can inflation and economic growth be tracked**\*\*?\*\* (A few examples)

1. **Headline CPI** – measures the rate of change of inflation on a monthly, quarterly, and annual basis
2. **Rent Inflation** – comprises 32% of the headline CPI
3. **Services Inflation** – comprises 57% of the headline CPI
4. **Import Prices** – rate of change in the prices of goods and services purchased from foreign sellers
5. **Producer Price Index** \- measures price change for commodities sold for personal consumption, capital investment, government, and export
6. **Chicago Fed National Activity Index** \- is designed to gauge overall economic activity and related inflationary pressure
7. **Capacity Utilization** \- used to measure the rate at which potential output levels are being met or used

**Why are we heading to a regime change which will be inflationary**\*\*?\*\*

**Let us begin by quickly summarizing the disinflationary drivers of the last 40 years** –

1. **China** – the country managed to bring over 600 million people into the workforce and out of poverty. This helped improve their lives but also provided cheap labor to the global economy. At the same time, China laid the massive manufacturing and logistics infrastructure which has made it the manufacturing powerhouse that it is today
2. **Collapse of USSR** – led to the migration of cheap labor from Eastern Europe to Mainland Europe
3. **Outsourcing** – exasperated with high inflation from the mid 1960’s to the mid 1980’s, developed economies willingly accepted the idea to outsource or offshore their manufacturing to China
4. **Immigration** – the same reason stated in point 3 led to developed economies opening up to immigration from developing economies which led to wages being driven down
5. **Debt** – Increase in debt (through monetary policy) led to businesses running on the loss-making model as well as increased competition
6. **Technology** – the ultimate disinflationary driver which made the World smaller, expedited exchange and execution of ideas, gaslighted innovation, and increased efficiency exponentially

**Now let us understand which of the above disinflationary drivers can slow down or turn inflationary** –

1. **China** – demography is getting older and wealthier and labor-intensive industries such as apparel and footwear are moving to Vietnam and Bangladesh. Also, it could be possible that new disinflationary drivers such as Vietnam, Bangladesh, and India can fill in the capacity of China.
2. **Outsourcing** – many developed countries have elected or are electing populist governments that promise to bring back the jobs by reshoring their industries. Also, Covid lockdowns and the Russian – Ukraine conflict has shown governments how globalized supply chains are vulnerable and de-risking supply chains to some extent by localizing them would be a strategic necessity.
3. **Immigration** – again, many developed countries have elected or are electing governments that promise or have a mandate in place that caps immigration which would cut off access to foreign cheap labor and talent.
4. **Debt** – many developed countries are running debt to GDP ratios in excess of 100% and any increase in debt through monetary policy would be a very unpopular opinion among the population

**And the new drivers of the Inflationary Regime?**

1. **ESG** – The transition to Net Zero involves a large negative supply shock and mega capex
2. **Inequality** – the disinflationary regime of the last 40 years worked in favor of the capitalists against the labor, and the monetary policies in place since 2008 exacerbated this inequality. The current inflationary period will put pressure on governments to work on closing the gap in inequality, which will further increase pressures on inflation
3. **Fiscal Policy** – governments are already putting money in the hands of the people so that they can weather the inflation or are providing subsidies. Fiscal policy is proven to be inflationary.

&amp;#x200B;

**As this is an abridged version, I have briefly listed the reasons for my base case of an inflationary regime. I believe that we are currently in a stagflation environment and may either remain in a stagflation environment for a while or alternate between an inflationary boom and stagflation.**

**Having said that, I would like to briefly mention a few of my thoughts or rather, my musings. Will post these musings in a Part 2 Post as this post is already long.**

**Will update this post with the link to Part 2 when I post it.**",0.71,3,0,3,dd,2022-11-04T19:58:07Z,ym5osp,t3

This post may seem like a joke, but it's not.

I earn approximately $3500 per year, that's right, not per month but per year lol.

That's why I always wanted to have a lot of money, not to spend on myself, but to give dignity and meet basic needs to my family.

That's when I realized that I should know the rules of the financial market, to play the money game.

I realized that there are a lot of unfair things, such as: The bank would lend me 125x an amount to invest in a stock, but they wouldn't lend me the same amount to finance a house.

So I decided to stop being sad about it, I accepted reality.

Overall, Big Tech stocks suffered a brutal selloff last week on the back of disappointing quarterly earnings. But Apple's stock has outperformed its peers after it beat Wall Street's revenue and profit forecasts for its fourth quarter.

The iPhone maker's shares soared 8% in the wake of its results. After their earnings reports, Meta plunged more than 20%, Amazon fell about 10%, while Alphabet saw a single-digit decline.

Alphabet, Amazon and Meta's lackluster earnings signaled that demand for digital advertising is flagging. The poorly-received results have helped wipe billions off their market values as their shares fell, and pushed Amazon out of the trillion-dollar market cap club.

Over the past five sessions, Apple's stock has risen 0.16%, while Alphabet has fallen 5.7%, Amazon is down 17.0% and Meta has lost 7.6% over that period.

Despite Apple's achievement, its market cap has fallen back from its $2.193 trillion value at the end of 2021. A series of headwinds — high inflation, rising interest rates, fears of recession and the Ukraine war among them — have meant tech stocks have struggled in 2022 as investors lost appetite for higher risk assets.

Florida-headquartered hedge fund Elliott Management believes the global economy is in an “extremely challenging” situation which could lead to hyperinflation.

In a report on Thursday (Nov 3), the Financial Times (FT) cited a letter sent to investors (and seen by the newspaper) that “investors should not assume they have ‘seen everything’” because they have been through the peaks and troughs of the 1987 crash, the dot-com boom and the 2008 global financial crisis and previous bear and bull markets.

The British daily newspaper said the firm, led by billionaire Paul Singer and Jonathan Pollock, added that the “extraordinary” period of cheap money is coming to an end and has “made possible a set of outcomes that would be at or beyond the boundaries of the entire post-WWII period”.

The letter said the world is “on the path to hyperinflation”, which could lead to “global societal collapse and civil or international strife”.

Elliott executives estimated that markets have not fallen enough yet and equity markets could drop more than 50% would be “normal”, adding that they couldn’t predict when that would happen.

They warned clients that the idea that “‘we will not panic because we have seen this before’ does not comport with the current facts”.

They blamed central bank policymakers for the current global economic situation, saying they had been “dishonest” about the reason for high inflation.

They said lawmakers had shirked responsibility by blaming it on supply chain disruption caused by the pandemic instead of loose monetary policy imposed two years ago during the Covid-19 peak.

In this regard, Powell only slightly adjusted the Fed’s view on inflation from “transitory” to “expected to be transitory.”

These divisions will be: Cannabis, Branding and a 3rd to be named later (this division is being created from within). Our plan provides for each of these divisions to be generating revenue by the end of December 2023.

We estimate that we will file the Super 8-K and financial statements within days after receiving the audit for Consolidated Apparel, Inc (""Consolidated""), which is currently producing about $1.2 million in annual revenues and will remove the Company's Shell designation and add revenue to our books. Consolidated has identified several acquisition targets that complement the Consolidated operations, which if assimilated will potentially increase annual revenues. These transactions, if completed will be structured as Asset Purchases to expedite closings.

In July of 2022, the Company issued 598,800 shares of Series B Preferred for 49.9% of GCTR Management, LLC (""GCTR""), a management company in the cannabis sector in California with two clients. GCTR currently grosses revenues of approximately $300,000 per month. We have an option to purchase the remaining 50.1% percent but will look to extend that date until the end of 2023, so we can pursue other opportunities to increase our presence in the cannabis sector in California. We will continually seek new acquisitions to potentially increase our revenues and will look to lock down 49.9% of two other entities with options to acquire the remaining portion by the end of 2023.

We have agreed to work on new projects with our partners in California with each side owning 50%.

Our new division is being set up from within services of a sector our management has decades of experience in, which we are planning to roll out during the 4th quarter of 2022.

Additionally, in the 4th quarter, we plan to begin setting up operations in the Caribbean to expand both our Branding and Cannabis divisions. For our Branding division, we plan to manufacture products on the island to be sold on the island and export products back to the United States. For Cannabis, we plan to acquire the real estate and equipment needed to operate a manufacturing operation. We will not be involved in the day-to-day operations, but plan to receive a monthly fee for the building and use of the equipment equal to 25% of the monthly revenue.

The Company, in compliance with SEC regulations, will use social media outlets like Facebook or Twitter and its own website at [www.igpk.org](http://www.igpk.org/) to announce key information in compliance with Regulation FD.

A new report delivered to Maryland lawmakers this week shows the national market for legal cannabis growing to $72 billion per year by 2030.

A $75 Billion Industry

The report, which was prepared and presented to the work group by Mathew Swinburne, associate director of Network for Public Health Law-Eastern Region of Baltimore, includes information from New Frontier Data that projects steady growth of the nationwide market as current markets mature and new states are added to the roster of legal cannabis states. Growing from $32 billion in 2022, the projection estimates a total market nationwide of $72 billion by 2030. 

“We know that the cannabis industry is a profitable industry,” said Swinburne. “This is a new industry that is filled with economic opportunity and that opportunity is only growing,” he added. “Although this industry presents some significant economic opportunities, communities of color are missing out on this cannabis boom.”

Swinburne told the work group that jobs in the cannabis industry rose from about 321,000 in 2020 to approximately 428,000 a year later. However, the report also notes that 81% of cannabis businesses are owned by white people and 58% of businesses have no employees who are members of minority groups. 

Main benefactors of this growth remain TRULIEVE, VERANO, GREENTHUMB, CURALEAF, CRESCO Labs 

The five largest MSOS - and most profitable - currently operating in USA.

Hip-hop mogul and entrepreneur is acquiring marijuana assets to be divested in merger of Cresco Labs and Columbia Care

Sean “Diddy” Combs has agreed to purchase licensed marijuana operations in three states for up to $185 million, adding a new business to a portfolio that includes fashion, media and spirits.

If approved by U.S. and state regulators, the deal could create the nation’s largest Black-owned and licensed cannabis company. Mr. Combs said he wants to use the business as a platform to increase Black participation in the cannabis industry.

He said he decided to enter the market to help address long-running inequities. Black people have been disproportionately arrested for marijuana crimes, research has shown. They also comprise a tiny percentage of those making money from the legal cannabis market. In the 26 years since California first legalized medical marijuana, cannabis has grown into a $27 billion legal business in the U.S. and is projected to reach $42 billion in annual U.S. sales by 2026, according to data service BDSA.

The recipients of the proceeds - cresco labs and columbia care who are merging - are one of the top five components of MSOS ETF - which includes TRULIEVE, VERANO, CURALEAF, and GREENTHUMB

This quarter’s unprecedented profitability growth is solid proof that our company’s strategy is paying off.

As a result of having acquired six vessels in the course of ten months, we generated net income of $15.5 million in a single quarter which is 15,400% higher than our profit in Q2 22’ and equivalent to 23% of our current market capitalization; We incurred moderate debt during the quarter, maintaining a healthy capital structure with $42.3 million of debt while preserving a free cash balance available for further fleet expansion of about $92 million. Given the strong market fundamentals and the promising charter rate environment and by taking advantage of our efficient management of our expanded fleet, we believe that we will achieve strong results and generate significant cash flow going forward. However, the valuation of our shares of common stock does not reflect our strong financial performance and capital available to fund our growth prospects.",0.58,3,0,3,news,2022-11-04T07:48:46Z,ylq6u3,t3

I spend money on almost nothing else but options/gambling. I've put around 20k into other business ventures like game development or e-commerce but I've lost all of that as well because of course those ventures led no-where.

61,wallstreetbets,c0diiii,self.wallstreetbets,8,The Hindenburg Omen - A Indicator Present When Market Conditions Are Ripe For A Crash,"\*\*\*For those of you interested in technical analysis, this post is for you. Before you read the long post, there is a link with a video that is more up to date on market conditions and shows the indicators in action. I thought this was a good topic for a discussion due to current market conditions.\*\*\*

**The Hindenburg Omen** \- A rare market signal with a foreboding name is telling traders to prepare for a possible significant decline. Invoking the memory of the flaming explosion of LZ 129 Hindenburg in 1937. The stock market “Hindenburg Omen” signal plays on images of a monumental disaster.

It is easy to see why many of such observations preceded the **35%** drop in the **S&amp;P 500** in early 2020 – certainly a stock market disaster by any measure. However, when these signals are present, it may be good practice to form an exit strategy and help mitigate any potential losses. Let’s dig into what this indicator is and why its signals are important warnings for precarious market circumstances. 

What is the Hindenburg Omen?

The Hindenburg Omen is a term used in stock trading where certain market conditions align to form a signal. For instance, it’s a warning that conditions are ripe for a steep market decline. 

What are the market conditions to incite this tumble? Look for the following four conditions all occurring on the same day:

* The number of new **NYSE** 52-week highs is greater than **2.8%** of all unchanged issues.
* The number of new **NYSE** 52-week lows is greater than **2.8%** of all unchanged issues.
* The number of new 52-week highs is not more than double the number of new 52-week lows.
* The **NYSE** Composite Index 50-day moving average is rising.

**These first two conditions are the important ones.**

Having a significant number of stocks making new 52-week highs at the same time. While a significant number are making new 52-week lows, signals an unhealthy market. When markets are well-behaved, most stocks tend to move together. When they do not, we should be warned and either readjust or improve our trading discipline. 

\*\*\***That warning puts us on notice that for the subsequent 30 days after any observation, there is a greater than normal chance of a crash on any one of those days where the McClellan oscillator is less than zero.\*\*\***

A Hindenburg Omen in 2022

Market observers saw some signals of another Hindenburg Omen as the markets started to decline in January of 2022. Whether this induces another crash remains to be seen. But it highlights why it is important to keep an eye out for indicators suggesting a crash. Especially in unpredictable markets. They are infrequent, but when they occur, it can give us an early warning to watch for signs that might corroborate a decline.

In late 2021 and again in early 2022, we saw a cluster of Hindenburg Omen observations, as recently as January 14th. That has put us on warning to look for exactly the kind of selling which we have already observed and the potential for even more. On any day when the McClellan oscillator is below zero, down moves could turn ugly.  

This warning sign will remain for a 30-day period from the last observation. When significant selling follows the omen and then turns the 50-day moving average of the **NYSE** composite index down, as it has in early 2022. There cannot be another, fresh Hindenburg observation until the moving average turns back up. Bear markets often begin with attempts to regain a new high which fail. Often this action can set up fresh Hindenburg Omen signals for a subsequent leg down. If markets do bounce, it will be something to watch for.

There are some who say that the Hindenburg, filled with hydrogen, was destined for disaster.  However, the airship traveled ten times from Germany to the United States without incident before the crossing where it burst into flames, and **36%** of those aboard perished.

**Likewise, not every observation of the Omen ends in a stock market disaster. It is, however, a sign of a dangerous condition.**

I found a supporting video that discusses this signal in detail with examples of charts and how you can set it up on our trading platform.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%. (Stats as of 2022-10-28)",0.84,9,0,9,dd,2022-11-04T02:32:00Z,yljvwz,t3

72,wallstreetbets,Able_Excuse_4456,self.wallstreetbets,14,Learn from my mistakes! (Selling Puts),"Not looking for advice here, just sharing some lessons that others may benefit.

I've been using equity Options for a couple years to boost yield. Not Robinhood, not even based on WSB, but legitimate income boosting from my own individual research. It started with simple covered Calls, and then I made a few quick bucks with cash-covered Puts. It was some of the easiest money I ever made.

Jim Cramer says that pigs get slaughtered. Unfortunately, I started getting piggish. Jim does have his moments from time to time.

I got a little looser with my Puts, by not having cash to cover in my brokerage account. I have the cash, but it's in Savings. I started making riskier Puts because they had nice premiums. Had to roll a few, even took a few debits, but was overall positive in taking free cash in exchange for a little risk.

My usual tactic was to watch for a symbol to lose 10-20% in a day, wait a day to stabilize, and then sell a Put for another 20% discount. And I'd get 5% annualized yield. They almost always expire harmlessly OTM. Money for nothing. Easy, right?

Some dipped too close for comfort, or even went ITM. No problem, I can roll. Once or twice, I had to open a new nearly-naked Put position to buy out or roll another one. Like paying off a credit card with another credit card. Financial coaches always recommend that kind of behavior, right?

Well, this week, I had 3 of these riskier semi-naked Put positions hit a trifecta. Bad press, bad earnings call, and the Fed Meeting. All 3 plunged 50-80% in days. Far below the Strike. Of the 3, there is really only 1 that I wouldn't mind owning.

Rolling will cost me almost all my gains from the last year, most of which are already invested into other shares that are covering a Call position. So I'll probably have to infuse more cash to buy back or roll at least 2 just to prevent a forced assignment 50% above the share price. Income accounts are meant to withdraw from, not dump more into just to avoid losing even more cash.

Please learn these lessons:

1. Don't sell a Put on a company that you don't want to own.
2. Have the cash in your brokerage to cover it.
3. Don't transact right before Earnings season when it's already a volatile stock.
4. Low volume Options are harder to roll your way out of.
5. Limit your Puts to 1-2 at any given time.
6. Don't be greedy.

Fortunately for me, these are all low dollar mistakes. I set a personal cap at $25 share price to sell a Put, and that saved my hide. Had this happened with high flyers like Meta, I'd be hosed.

Hear me out. FuboTV is reporting earnings tomorrow morning. There's been an uptick on Google searches for Fubo in the past 3 months alongside increased searches in related topics of sports TV subscriptions:

* [https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=%2Fg%2F11c60pfzx6&amp;geo=US](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=%2Fg%2F11c60pfzx6&amp;geo=US)

Compare this to Roku, which did not experience this search uptick. Roku also spent a lot of capital on physical Roku TVs, which the markets punished after its earnings yesterday. Fubo is unburdened by these types of capital expenditures.

* [https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=%2Fm%2F0\_x7l9\_](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=%2Fm%2F0_x7l9_)

Currently, **short interest in FUBO is 24.95%**. With Fubo trading at all time lows, Fubo just has to not report terrible earnings and awful future projections (subscriptions by sports fans are quite resilient to recessions because it's an ""affordable luxury"") for the stock to rally. This domino can lead to a squeeze.

First of Degens I don't like FB which has 2 billion users still a day I also don't care much for mark Z which is either James Halliday  from Ready player one or IOI, I feel its the latter.

\*I don't care for their policies but I do still keep FB because of family and friends, easiest way to find someone, I also Use IG a lot more lately, and whatsapp.

\* I don't care for Z's meta dream currently but I like the cash generating machine and I like todays 2015 valuation. Here is my thesis for long $META.

META dropped -38% in the last 8 days! Which is a +60% upside to OCT 27th prices. I have a feeling funds will be averaging down soon. See charts below.

https://preview.redd.it/wrzy8aklftx91.png?width=1396&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39bfeff5b048823067907033f7fc049ca2535e23

&amp;#x200B;

[META is projected to grow  to record rev in 2023 to 2025 still and just needs to cut spending. ](https://preview.redd.it/yf06wq8patx91.png?width=2110&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01a967cbf7c19800ac2970d23463433cae9e6796)

First of lets talk about why META is down. Obviously when other tech stocks, some of the biggest in the world can drop -20% overnight like AMZN recently did, NFLX -39% overnight it shows we are in one of the most volatile markets ever. Never have we seen such giant market caps drop this much. So this for 1 presents a big opportunity for me.

:Note NFLX has recovered from that -39% overnight drop and is still up 65% since even with the big drop this past week. It recovered 88% in around 4 months time even with the NASDAQ falling -30% since its drop.

https://preview.redd.it/871e3q18ctx91.png?width=1371&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e12efa6bbc5b3e13656784111d463108b1784ec

&amp;#x200B;

The main reason META is down is because of their spending, but many think Meta is spending only on the METAVERSE which is not the case. Their big spending is for the following which will generate record future cash flow with their current ad rev strategy on new platforms.

**Reasons for future Rev growth even in a recession.**

1)Instagram reels fully monetized

2)Whatsapp &amp; Messenger monetization

3) New AI Discovery Engine to make ad targeting more effective with higher average revenue per user.

4) 2.93+ Billion family users fully monetized.

5)An economic downturn recovery &amp; or more spending for ads again.

**Revenue declined slightly because of the following &amp; can rebound quick**

IMO it is Cyclical as number of users are increasing and user time is rising.

1. U.S. Dollar was beating other currencies and Meta gets a lot of ad rev in international markets.
2. A lot of ads from finance have slowed, the highest paying ads, once we sees a rise in market sentiment those ads come back.

3)Instagram and facebook  reels are not being monetized YET which gets 140 BILLION reels played DAILY!, neither is Messenger and Whatsapp.

4)Apples 2021 Privacy changes, Note The New AI discovery engine will fix this for Meta.

5) Mark and management have started record spending currently on infrastructure /AI discovery engine which is what they are spending the most.

6) 2022 expenses $85-87 2023 projected $96 to $101 billion, which Meta can still be cash flow positive but Mark should and could revamp some spending and do this over 2 years vs 1 and the stock could see a massive move up as funds come back.

7) Many funds have far higher averages and IMO could start averaging up.

These funds below have added before the big drop! Algos have likely been selling as well.

[META is still top 100 revenue generating companies in the entire world ranked at 65 for rev, and 19 out of 7126 for Earnings STILL.](https://preview.redd.it/qbtgcdfdhtx91.png?width=1293&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=863a7752f43c17aea1b9b7d5a40ba6122dc50e3e)

If the meteverse works out this company is projected to 10x to 25x from todays valuations. 236 Billion and could bring in more revenue than the major stocks with massive overheads AMZN WMT etc with META having little overhead.

 Meta has a family of 3 billion users and growing. Starlink from Elon is  helping third world countries get internet and those are new people to  social media. I have a friend a brazilian actress that visited an amazon  tribe and they are using FB and Instagram and especially whatsapp now  on smart phones. Seriously! Billions of more users open up to social  media as Starlink progresses. People only think in their own bubble and  forget there are billions of people that love metas products. 

TLDR: If meta comes out with a revised spending plan the stock could gap up overnight, They could stretch spending over 2 years vs 1. Even if Metaverse does not work out it can easily 3x from here as spending is for AI ad growth with new infrastructure. Funds Should start to average down soon.

Hope you enjoyed this DD. I like buying Undervalued stocks I got in GME at $4.50 and posted here about it. Not saying Meta is going to go up but I am using profits this year to YOLO it.

# Hedge fund Elliott warns of more pain to come after 2022 market rout

Prominent asset manager says ‘hyperinflation’ could spark one of the worst crises since the second world war

The world is on the road to “hyperinflation” and could be heading towards its worst financial crisis since the second world war, according to Elliott Management, one of the world’s biggest and most influential hedge funds.

The Florida-based firm, which was founded by billionaire Paul Singer and manages about $56bn in assets, has warned its clients of an “extremely challenging” situation for the global economy and for financial markets where investors will find it difficult to make money.

An “extraordinary” set of financial extremes that come as the era of cheap money draws to a close “have made possible a set of outcomes that would be at or beyond the boundaries of the entire post-WWII period,” it wrote in the letter, which was seen by the Financial Times.

“Investors should not assume they have ‘seen everything’” just because they have experienced financial crises such as the 1970s bear market and oil price shock, the 1987 market crash, the dotcom bust or the 2008 financial crisis, it added.

Elliott declined to comment.

The group’s warning comes during a dismal year for markets, in which global equities have shed $28tn in value, according to Bloomberg data, and bonds have also tumbled, leaving investors with few places to seek shelter.

The fund manager laid much of the blame for the looming crisis on central bank policymakers, which it said had been “dishonest” about the causes of high inflation by blaming it on supply chain bottlenecks in the wake of the pandemic, rather than on ultra-loose monetary policy put in place at the height of the coronavirus crisis in 2020.

The world is “on the path to hyperinflation”, it said, which could lead to “global societal collapse and civil or international strife”. While such an outcome is not certain, this is currently the direction that the world was headed, it added.

Its warnings come as investors try to assess the economic damage likely to be felt from a rapid series of large interest rate increases in the US and elsewhere, as central bankers race to try to curb soaring inflation.

The S&amp;P has dropped 20 per cent since its peak at the start of this year, while the Nasdaq is down by one-third since its high a year ago.

However, Elliott said markets had not fallen far enough, given the many risks present, and warned of a further reversal of the so-called ‘everything rally’ seen near the top of the bull market of recent years, as sky-high investor exuberance lifted all manner of risky assets.

There are so many “frightening and seriously negative possibilities” that it is hard not to think that “a seriously adverse unwind of the everything bubble” is coming, it said.

The hedge fund estimates a 50 per cent fall from peak to trough would be “normal”, suggesting further large falls to come in major equity markets, although it added it was impossible to know whether or when that would happen.

Elliott, which is up 6.4 per cent in 2022 and which has only lost money in two calendar years since launch in 1977, pointed to a handful of areas of potential stress that could accelerate market falls. It highlighted banks’ losses on bridge financing, potential markdowns of collateralised loan obligations and leveraged private equity as areas of potential risk for markets.

The firm was also critical of investors who believed market falls will always prove shortlived and can be “ignored”.

The idea that “‘we will not panic because we have seen this before’ does not comport with the current facts”, it said.",0.76,56,0,56,chart,2022-11-04T00:53:12Z,ylhggj,t3

10,wallstreetbets,Kelanfarx,self.wallstreetbets,212,ASTS - An Investment and A Trade (I),"# 1/ ASTS - An Investment and A Trade

If you are a non-virgin, you understand that the sole purpose for investing and trading is to generate returns, to increase the NAV of your brokerage account and to push your net worth in the upward direction. Why? Because it feels good to have the monetary freedom to do whatever the fuck you want, because green GAIN porn is better than red loss porn, and because it is better to look at your account balance and smile instead of twitch in misery. You are here to make money. You are not here to “be right,” — you are here to generate returns, and preferably, returns in excess of the market, in so much excess of the SPY that you are catapulted towards massive capital appreciation (meaningful tendies) before age 80.

The challenge obviously is that it’s extremely fucking difficult to extract money from the markets, especially with an appropriate level of risk. Unless you are a boomer investing with a 50 year horizon, the markets are designed to fuck you over. Markets are difficult and good opportunities are scarce, especially in a bear market environment like we’ve seen YTD. But remember Warren Buffet said “be something when others are something”? Yes, and today is your opportunity.

Right now, an asymmetrical risk-reward investment window is present in ASTS, a company called AST SpaceMobile, where (i) the disruptive technology and scalable commercialization plan are set to create immense value in the coming months, years and decades, (ii) the macro environment allows for a chance to get in *early* into a potential “millionaire maker” name like NVDA or TSLA, and (iii) a contrarian and concentrated bet can provide incredible upside with manageable level of risk.

I am going to spare you impatient people who are already desperately looking for a TLDR from the “generational opportunity” technical thesis but instead show you the swing TRADE SETUP in ASTS that in my mind has a chance of printing money in the next few weeks and months. Three factors: (1) three meaningful catalysts in mid November, (2) continued business plan execution updates, (3) forces from market participants, potentially with better macro tailwinds, could make the ASTS stock spike, consolidate and push upward in a staircase pattern to high levels. Read on.

# 2/ The Background and the Backers

Notwithstanding the fact that Cathie Wood is washed up, disruptive technology wins in the long-term. Not Roku or Zoom but TRUE innovation that propels humankind forward. ASTS pushes forward that kind of technology, aiming to become the first comprehensive space-based cellular service provider, bridging the connectivity gap across the globe by providing high speed internet access to billions of unconnected people, and powering billions of others who move in and out of coverage even in developed markets like the US.

ASTS is launching a network of satellites to provide these services to any mobile device on the planet. That is achieved through deploying and operating satellite “cell towers” in orbit that will cover the entire Earth with 4G / 5G / LTE signal. The technology links directly to any unmodified smartphone, and unlike Starlink, doesn’t require any additional hardware. This monumental step forward in global connectivity is done through launching proprietary 168 BlueBird satellites into orbit and beaming signal through ASTS patented technology.

All sounds dreamy but this achievement means little for ASTS stock without a solid plan for commercialization. ASTS monetizes the technology through B2B revenue sharing agreements with existing global MNOs like AT&amp;T or Vodafone, who already back the company and even have repeated investments in ASTS. These profit sharing mechanisms effectively remove any customer acquisition or CRM costs for ASTS, and open the opportunity for fat free cash flow margins (Transhumanica thinks 90%+ EBITDA margins) after the network is operational.

Right now, ASTS is on path for business plan execution with one of the main hurdles, having the first BlueWalker 3 satellite in space, already complete in September. The BlueWalker 3 is now orbiting Earth at 17,000 mph and is ready to start “unfurling” on November 10th with testing shortly thereafter.

The TEAM: Abel Avellan, Rakuten, Invesat, Vodafone, AMERICAN TOWER corporation.

The guy in charge, the CEO is Abel Avellan. A chad who was founder of another satellite-based communications company EMC that he sold for $550M in July 2016, using proceeds for initial funding of ASTS. He is executing on the business plan with skin in the game with 78M shares (\~$500M currently) and majority of his networth tied in ASTS shares.

Other direct backers that have stakes include **Rakuten, Invesat, Vodafone and American Tower Corporation**. On top of that ASTS has partnerships and conversations with multiple MNOs in different jurisdictions to provide their service through the B2B revenue sharing model once satellites are operational.

# 3/ The Astrology and the Price

As a former SPAC, ASTS first got attention in late 2020 and participated in the high-growth mania of that period, reaching a peak price of over $25 in February 2021. To me, that price action is of little significance as it was fueled by an incredible frenzy in overall markets, which soon deflated and normalized later in the year. The company de-SPACed in April 2021. Since then, ASTS displayed remarkable resilience despite being a high-growth, unprofitable company in a very punishing macro environment, where rising interest rates have caused the valuation DCF discount rates to go up, valuation multiples to go down, acutely hurting stocks that have more expected FCF value in the future.

The market is a mystery and it can price something far from true value for a long time. It’s hard to value ASTS as most cash flow is in the future. To me, if execution is good, I’d just do $5B EBITDA in 2026 and 8x multiple, discounted to today at 20% – we’d see $100+ per share valuation. Of course it’s a bit binary so we have to be aware of the downside risks with execution at zero. Nevertheless the equity research people are bullish including Deutsche Bank, Barclays, BRiley. You can also take a look at numbers at Transhumanica or peruse through spacanpanman’s Twitter with more research and projections summarized neatly.

Deutsche Bank note from August when ASTS spiked on BlueWalker news:

[Deutsche Bank comment](https://preview.redd.it/ntirufb0osx91.png?width=992&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2800afe12df4affb7e6f9bd89f88f695ab84b4e5)

Interestingly, from June 1, 2022 to present the daily return correlation between ASTS and SPY/QQQ has been remarkably low at around 0.38, which I view as a good thing. Less dependent on daily volatility BS from indexes.

ASTS has traded in a huge channel from the lows of $5.50 to the highs of $14.00 since March 2021 to present. Previous multi-year stock “winners” they all came out of incredibly long consolidation bases which we observe here.

[ TradingView chart of ASTS, 1W ](https://preview.redd.it/dliwwerfqsx91.png?width=1813&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f0034d94a9bd64156001576681377529e74819c)

ASTS year-to-date performance as of October 26 is around -22.8%, compared to the QQQ -34.3%. For a high growth stock, it shows incredible strength — compare it with names like ARKK that are down -62.0% YTD, big dog ABNB -45.2% and SNOW -53.8%. This relative strength gives an indication that despite being currently unprofitable ASTS is likely going to be a leader going forward. Strong stocks are often future winners.

Pretty much from early July to mid-August the indexes grinded higher with QQQ up around 20% — during that time ASTS consolidated in a narrow range. After a few catalysts and good reports in early August, ASTS jumped from around $6.5 to around $14 in a matter of a few weeks. At $14 supply zone, the price action slowed and got slammed down with the overall market and sellers, pushing it down with more inflation worries and higher interest rates woes.

Now we are back at the “support” or demand area, at so-called lows where risk-to-reward becomes super attractive.

# 4/ The Dangers of a Bearish Trade and Previous Catalysts

The no-brainer trade this year was to short unprofitable technology and do nothing but watch how the overall market punishes those stocks. That was the “easy” trade on a company like ASTS that sellers capitalized on. The downward adjustment of multiples due to higher interest rates pushed DCF valuation models lower and ASTS price has been sinking. Naturally, sellers use the opportunity to profit from a structural decline where not much can be done really, the tide goes down and takes every ship down with it. BUT, this can be dangerous when a company is executing on the business plan and has positive developments.

This year we had 2 catalysts that showed what can happen when ASTS keeps executing on the business plan.

1. On March 9, 2022 the news came out that ASTS partnered with SpaceX to deliver their satellites to space. That proved ASTS is meaningfully moving forward with its objectives, and resulted in a ferocious seller covering rally that day, where just “riding with tide” as a seller backfired massively. ASTS stock almost doubled in a day: from lows of $6.20 to highs of $11.40. Later, macro pressures set in again, pushing ASTS lower and the “easy” bear trade came back in, sinking all high risk assets.
2. On July 28, 2022 yet another positive news momentum came in with BW3 satellite launch, that forced a lot of sellers to get out of the way. The frenzied rally more than doubled the stock price in a few weeks. Price went from $6.20 to $14.20, then received expected push back and yielded with broad market weakness.

After Kerrisdale released their bearish report in mid-September price nose dived and we visited the $6 “support area” and bottom of the channel. Interesting to note that previous 2 times, the stock launched from around $6.20.

I think right now there is little idiosyncratic movement to the stock, mostly macro pushing it lower, but that is about to change. Now is an optimal time to get in because we are the bottom of the channel and 3 massive catalysts are upcoming next week, hopefully aided by the tailwinds from macro (not guaranteed) and pressures from sellers relenting as company executes.

# 5/ The New LONG Trade and Upcoming Catalysts

We have an ER update call on Monday, November 14. The three main events will serve as proof of company execution and are likely to push the price up in the next few weeks.

1. Unfurling of the BW3 satellite is going to happen on November 10. Successful completion is likely to serve as a big catalyst to the stock. Satellite will open up and become operational and ready for testing.

[Furled](https://preview.redd.it/5y3wecosqsx91.png?width=643&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd2ae1d0649d74a9db5fe749c1856a6d70bd0d6e)

[Unfurled](https://preview.redd.it/ew43yfytqsx91.png?width=651&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=916c4d08e26af04ecfd10f47c8a29ee23fe2dce1)

2. Testing of the satellite should happen shortly thereafter and an announcement confirmation of working technology is going to be an even larger event for ASTS. This will be the proof that technology works with MNOs.

3. Other funding or partnership updates, like 5G Fund providing indication of possible financing to ASTS may happen by the end of the year, as well as getting licenses in new jurisdictions (Japan), or more partnerships with MNOs.

[Comments on ASTS eligibility for being financed by FCC's 5G Fund](https://preview.redd.it/g1iknnuvqsx91.png?width=1093&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83b7a48437c40c0dc87d4b6a3f9a2ab964afeb4f)

One of the arguments of sellers is that company will need additional funding before generating meaningful free cash flow. Currently they do have runway to revenue, and that gets even better if the FCC 5G fund awards capital to ASTS or if price stays at $18+ for a month, where warrants become redeemable for $200M of capital. Moreover, there’s other non-dilutive financing options, but regardless I think they’ll be explored in second half of 2023 or later.

&amp;#x200B;

[From spacanpanman](https://preview.redd.it/co5m5bc0rsx91.png?width=1194&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a1991c6fc6b4ae4c8fef5e73a7840c35434eeac)

The reason why I think the moves up on positive news could be violent is because there will be additional buying pressure from bearish traders to get cover their positions in face of good data.

Once ASTS confirms that these events are successful, stock will likely become favored by passive and risk-averse investors, with institutional funds buying in and momentum/breakout traders scaling into positions. I believe we’ll get to $14 area if updates are positive, and a breakout above that is likely to clean the path to $18+ which I think is going to be the turning point for the company, that will set it up for long term success.

[ASTS 1D timeframe, imaginary price action.](https://preview.redd.it/wrcwev02ssx91.png?width=1814&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c19d086660cb232eff0c4b823b17f25bc91d5f2d)

Disclaimer, Risks:

Past performance is not indicative of future results. This is not financial advice. There are risks of company failing and stock going to zero.

TLDR:

The no brainer trade this year was to short unprofitable technology and just sit tight. But it is dangerous now, especially on a company like ASTS, which is a powder keg that can explode on successful business developments that are to be announced on November 10 and shortly after. Three upcoming catalysts are likely to serve as a repeat of price action in March and August. Although price is artificially suppressed by the macro environment, once that pressure subsides, the stock will stay high and keep pushing forward as company executes.

12,wallstreetbets,DaddyDersch,self.wallstreetbets,16,"11-3-22 SPY/ ES Futures, Apple and Tesla Daily Market Analysis","Well the day after the FOMC meeting proved to be pivotally boring. After a pretty exciting pre market with how red we opened (bless up for my over night puts) we after the first 45 minutes of the day held the same about $3 range all day long. With a love volume red day it seems there is a lot of sidelines money right now and we could end up seeing buyers step back in. I am cautiously optimistic for tomorrow bull wise though. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/un24xy0nrsx91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f21e31cb538ba7322c65e8041bc1f095f301074b

The biggest thing that I mentioned bear wise that happened yesterday was that we broke through key 378 support (green channel). I had mentioned that 370.5 was another big area. I highlighted it here to make it a little more clear. You can see that there is a clear resistance/ support line right there. With SPY breaking through and then holding over it all day and closing over it today I am actually looking for an upside resistance test. 

SPY has put in 4 red days in a row now so it could be expected we get a green day. The other oddity to say the least is that SPY closed down -1.02% and the VIX also closed down -2.28%. Usually I would say that doesn’t happen but in 2022 and lately its happening more and more. Despite everything the JPOW said yesterday the fear isn’t rising in the markets. This is either  sign by the VIX that we should continue to be bullish and expect upside or this is a really “cheap” opportunity to buy some longer DTE puts. 

Bulls will want to defend 370.5 tomorrow again and more or less leave it in the dust and completely gap fill 374.76 tomorrow. From there they need to retest the 378 resistance line and attempt to break back into that zone. 

Bears will want to finally take out 370.5 and close below it with hopes of testing 365 to 359.9 tomorrow and into next week. This is the first time we have had a full candle close below the daily 8ema since before CPI. 

Key support- 370.5 -&gt; 365 -&gt; 359.9

Key resistance- 374.6 -&gt; 378

Looking at futures we nicely held resistance at 3770 and were not quite able to break through support at 3705. Bulls will look to retake 3770 and possibly key 3805 tomorrow. 

Bears will look to continue the sell off and seek out 3705 and most importantly 3675 support.

Apple looked incredibly heavy compared to the rest of the market and actually was the worst top 10 ticker of the day just barely beating out Google. Interestingly enough Apple is only $3 away from its after hours low of 136 on earnings day. 

Now that Apple is back at the 138.2 support area this is where we can look for it to bounce if it is going to bounce. However, something to keep in mind is that unlike tesla and other stocks Apple has NOT put in its 2nd 52week low… this very well could be its attempt at doing so. 

We have a nice black downward channel inside of a falling wedge that also have a falling wedge inside of the black channel… lol yes I know right? 

Key support- 138.2 -&gt; 135 -&gt; 130

Tesla continues to be all over the place. We did see it break through that “mid” point of 215 today however it was able to find support nicely at 210. However, it did break through the 2 day drop resistance line it was not able to break through and take out the daily 8ema this morning and had a pretty strong rejection there. I will be looking to see if Tesla finds support here with this doji on a downrend which can lead to an upside recovery or if it will indeed retest 205.6 support tomorrow.

The VIX just absolutely continues to unwind here and doesn’t seem to be phased by anything at all anymore. What will cause the VIX to spike and revery back to the 28-30+ range? Honestly im not sure at this point. The really only big bear event ahead is CPI next Thursday but besides that we have nothing till December. December actually is doing to be a Doozy with CPI on a Tuesday immediately followed the next day by FOMC. 

This CPI still does not have a consensus out… which gives me the same type of vibes from last September CPI which could result in a bigger sell off again. I wouldnt be surprised to see a short rally tomorrow till next week. Markets are looking for that “oh wow yeah lets sell” reason again and I don’t forsee one till CPI. CPI most likely will miss and that’s where it gets complicated. On one hand we know jpow said he isn’t ready to slow or pause… he said inflation aint fixed… so another bad CPI maybe he rockets a 100bps at us? Definitely another 75bps at us… how will markets react? Will we react like September or will we react like October.

We also get to add in the unemployment rate to the mix tomorrow if you remember last month when this hit we had an incredibly red open when this news hits the market.

The ad plan, dubbed ""Basic with Ads,"" will cost $6.99 a month in the U.S. — just below Disney's ad-based price point of $7.99 (which will roll out on December 8.)

""Basic with Ads"" will complement Netflix's existing ad-free tiers and be available in 12 countries, including the U.S., the U.K., Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, and Spain.

The ad tier will feature an average of 4-to-5 minutes of ads per hour. At launch, ads will run 15 or 30 seconds in length, with some running prior to the start of a program while others will be mid-roll ads.

Wall Street analysts are largely bullish on the profitability aspects of the new ad tier, and advertising experts refer to the debut as a make-or-break moment for the media industry.

""It is absolutely a pivotal moment for the industry,"" Kevin Krim, CEO of advertising measurement platform EDO, told Yahoo Finance, citing Amazon's (AMZN) Thursday Night Football as another watershed moment when streaming, subscription, and ad-supported went to the masses.

Looking back, the executive explained, this ""will be the moment where the vast majority of Americans became crystal clear that there's going to be a new way to get the must-watch TV that they care about — and it's going to be through a subscription-based and an ad-supported business model.""

Amid concerns that Netflix subscribers will trade down to the ad-supported version, Citi Managing Director Jason Bazinet previously told Yahoo Finance Live that he views the introduction of advertising as a lucrative revenue driver.

""It's not a spin down risk — it's a spin up opportunity,"" the analyst maintained, estimating that the company could secure $10 or more in advertising revenue per ad-tier subscriber in the U.S.

Based on me being 15% down on my position (7000 shares @ $4.02) and the 2 hours (maybe 1.5) of ""research"" I've done, I have concluded that this stock is underpriced.

The stock is reeling from the news that CVS has likely pulled a purchase offer, but it seems like everyone has forgotten that Humana $HUM is still looking to buy, always had right of first refusal, and is primed to purchase (still up 30% on the year). Both CVS and Humana are desperate to get more of that Medicare Advantage plan money and are basically fighting to buy the company. CVS reportedly stated in their conference call that they are still looking to get into primary care through acquisitions, and failed on their attempt to purchase One Medical who was instead bought by Amazon. Meaning the ""news"" of their pullout is likely bullshit to get $CANO back on sale for the institutions before the actual buyout. Not to mention the market cap of CANO is $1 billion less than the enterprise value (whatever that means, it seems good). Analyst's lowest forecast is $4.04, still giving this an %18 upside worst case scenario and a buyout could reasonably drive this to $12 if not higher. 

In summation, $CANO is an opportunity for free money.",0.59,4,0,4,dd,2022-11-03T18:41:17Z,yl7kw5,t3

Let me explain my theory on profit vs debt","It’s counter intuitive but many companies don’t want to make profit these days. There are many problems with being profitable. First you have to pay tax on profits. Second making profit is actually difficult. Third if you start to make profit it will never be enough for the market and you can’t sell a story of hyper growth company to pump your stocks.

What companies really wanted is asset appreciation whether it be their stocks or real estate. In world of money printing, cheap debt and fiat system, most asset values always go up in price over time. 

Appreciating assets allows businesses to cash out refinance at lower rates. Unlike profit, this borrowed money is tax free as per IRS. The tax free borrowed money is then used to boost revenues through ads, pump stocks thru buybacks &amp; sustain lifestyle of executives and their sugar babies. 

The ponzi continues because some of the borrowed money is used to pump the asset prices. Declining rates help as well. As the debt servicing costs decline it boosts the asset prices allowing businesses to get new round of cash out refinance, pay down smaller debt with bigger debt and continue the ponzi.

Powell grew up in different world where companies actually relied on profits for their liquidity. Not anymore. Business models rely heavily on cheap debt these days. In fact they prefer tax free cheap debt over taxable profits which requires running an efficient business and not just financial engineering.

Powell doesn’t understand simple fact it was the declining rates of last 40 years and access to tax free cheap debt that provided liquidity to businesses and also allowed them to keep prices low for their consumers and inflation in check.

The revenue increase was driven by stable growth in the Nights and Experiences booked and elevated average daily rates.

But Airbnb provided fourth-quarter revenue guidance of $1.80 billion and $1.88 billion, below the midpoint of $1.85 billion as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.

Airbnb said to “expect a continued, albeit choppy, recovery of cross-border travel to be a further tailwind to future results” as countries around the world continue to recover from Covid lockdowns and grapple with high levels of inflation and rising interest rates.

6,wallstreetbets,predictany007,self.wallstreetbets,4,"Guggenheim downgrades Roku, citing warning signs after latest quarterly report","Analyst Michael Morris downgraded the television streaming stock to neutral from buy and removed his price target on the name. He previously had a target of $70 per share on Roku.

“We believe in the long-term opportunity for CTV and see Roku’s active account base and operating assets as valuable,” he said in a note to clients, referencing the app CTV that allows users to watch TV. “However, we struggle to value the business given the lack of detail from the company and the warning indicators.”

On Wednesday, the company issued fourth-quarter revenue guidance that was well below expectations, along with a larger-than-expected adjusted EBITDA forecast. Roku did reported a smaller-than-expected loss for the third quarter, but Morris noted those expectations were already slashed as the business has suffered.

He called the fourth-quarter guidance the “primary surprise,” noting it was “well below” prior forecasts and implied revenue declines due to a drop in up-front spending from advertisers. But he still expects the company to beat when reporting fourth-quarter earnings.

Fourth-quarter total net revenue guidance was predicted by Guggenheim to be 1% lower than the same quarter a year ago. The firm previously expected it to grow 4% in the quarter. Ad revenue is expected to decline 5% in the quarter after being forecast to grow by 7%, while total platform revenue should grow 0.5% compared to the 6% growth expected before the earnings call.

Morris said there is concern over the magnitude of the soft cyclical environments impact on advertising space not bought at the “upfront” event.

Meanwhile, he said the company is still operating at a loss and is likely to increase spending if conditions improve. He also pointed to what he called a lack of visibility into the company’s business drivers such as advertising revenue trends, investment goals and profitability objectives that make it hard to predict future performance.

The stock plummeted 19% in premarket trading following the earnings release Wednesday. Roku has taken a beating this year, losing more than 76.2% through Wednesday’s close.

On Nov. 1st, Uber reported better-than-expected quarterly results. It reported an adjusted loss of 61 cents a share on revenue of $8.34 billion. Analysts expected Uber to report a loss of 18 cents a share on revenue of $8.1 billion. 

Uber's total gross bookings were $29.12 billion, slightly below expectations of $29.67 billion. But the company expects total fourth-quarter bookings to rise 23% to 27% from a year earlier. Uber also gave its fourth-quarter profit before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) guidance range of $600 million to $630 million. Wall Street was expecting $567 million.

Meanwhile, UBER also sees positive comments from Evercore ISI’s Tech analyst Mark Mahaney and Wedbush’s analyst Dan Ives. According to Mark Mahaney, Uber is part of the $2 trillion global ride-sharing and delivery market. He thinks the company is on track to grow bookings by about 30% from its current 90 million customers.

""Uber is continuing to see healthy growth as the driver shortage is essentially over while the company continues to benefit from travel returning, shifting to the office, as other post-pandemic trends continue to hold globally with Uber poised to benefit into 2023,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to clients.

20,wallstreetbets,Guilty-Ham,self.wallstreetbets,83,‘Dramatic increase.’ Foreclosure filings are up more than 150%. Here’s what that tells us about the housing market,"The number of foreclosure starts — which is when the first public foreclosure notice happens — is up 219% since the start of the year, according to real estate data analytics firm ATTOM Data Solutions’ midyear 2022 U.S. foreclosure market report. What’s more, the number of properties that had foreclosure filings (this number includes foreclosure starts) is up 153% from the same time period last year. 

Fully 96% of major metro areas saw an annual increase in foreclosure filings, with foreclosure rates highest in Illinois, New Jersey and Ohio. And when it comes to the number of foreclosure starts, California topped the list, followed by Florida, Tennessee, Illinois and Ohio.

“Foreclosure activity across the United States continued its slow, steady climb back to pre-pandemic levels in the first half of 2022,” says Rick Sharga, executive vice president of market intelligence at ATTOM. “While overall foreclosure activity is still running significantly below historic averages, the dramatic increase in foreclosure starts suggests that we may be back to normal levels by sometime in early 2023,” says Sharga. (See the lowest mortgage rates you can get here.)
What does this uptick in foreclosures mean for the housing market?

Foreclosures are shooting up as the various foreclosure moratoriums that kept people in their homes during the worst of the pandemic’s economic disruptions have now ended, explains Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com. That said, they are shooting up from extremely low levels, she adds — noting that even after the sharp increase in foreclosure activity observed in the first half of 2022, we’re still not back to 2019’s low pre-pandemic mid-year total.

“Much like the sharp turnaround in housing inventory that we’ve observed in the number of for-sale homes recently, when the market has tilted in one direction very extremely, we see huge percentage increases when the trends shift back in a different direction, even though in many aspects what we’re witnessing is just a return to something resembling what was once normal,” says Hale.

Indeed, “it’s important to note that many of the foreclosure starts we’re seeing today — in fact, much of the overall foreclosure activity we’re seeing right now is on loans that were either already in foreclosure or were more than 120 days delinquent prior to the pandemic,” says Sharga. Indeed, many of these loans were protected by the foreclosure moratorium put in place by the government during the pandemic — therefore just halting the inevitable by a couple of years. Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate says, “Foreclosure activity is returning to normal levels after being artificially depressed by pandemic-induced payment relief programs and extended foreclosure moratoriums. In a historical context, foreclosures are still very low.”

And while these foreclosure numbers sound dramatic, Holden Lewis, home and mortgage expert at NerdWallet, says it’s not enough to make a dent in the housing market or the overall economy. “Even a healthy housing market has foreclosures, and this pace is nothing to worry about,” says Lewis.
What does this mean for buyers?

While foreclosures remain unfortunate for the owners of those homes, for shoppers who have been frustrated by the lack of homes for sale in their budget, the increase in foreclosures could bring additional options, says Hale. “But much like the increases we see in for-sale housing inventory, it’s just the first step. We would need to see many more months of these increases before home shoppers will feel like they have an abundance of homes to choose from,” says Hale. source without paywall: https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marketwatch.com%2Fpicks%2Fdramatic-increase-foreclosure-filings-are-up-more-than-150-heres-what-that-tells-us-about-the-housing-market-01659181360",0.93,99,0,99,news,2022-11-03T10:01:19Z,ykvrzo,t3

*  The next step might be 50 basis points.
* More hikes are coming.
* The terminal rate is going to be higher.
* Fed is trying to give investors hope by slowing of rate hike pace but not pivoting at the same time.
* It takes 9-12 months for rate hikes to be felt and 12-18 months for the maximum effect. It makes sense to slow down the current pace given we are only eight months past the first rate hike.
* Fed will want slower total and core inflation, pullbacks in house prices and rents, slower wage growth, lower job openings, and likely an increase in the unemployment rate prior to a real pivot.
* Fed is also concerned about the upcoming winter heating season that may cause another spike in energy prices.
* Rate hikes are likely to continue into 2023 in smaller increments.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%. (Stats as of 2022-10-28)",0.8,12,0,12,dd,2022-11-03T04:30:07Z,ykpuun,t3

Does that mean earnings is likely going be bad?  As they could of announced this “somewhat” good news on earnings, but decided to issues the news a day prior to earnings.

The specific company I am talking about is Virgin Galactic SPCE.  Earnings is tomorrow and while they have no earnings the expectation is that their spaceship fleet is ready to fly.  However might get delayed.

Today they provided a update that they have found suppliers for their next generation fleet.

Listening through the meeting and listening it through it again, I do sense a bit dovishness in his speech. More so than I had originally anticipated looking at the underlying economic data. Caveat to that is it really involves one thing, the rate of increase, not overall Fed Fund rate increase. On the latter, it looks like he's taking that 25 bps and going to push it towards the Feb meeting. I'm overall still bearish for the time being. 

The rate hike that I initially anticipated would be 75 bps for December. It's looking highly more likely that'll it'll be 50 bps. That said, it's looking way more likely that Feb will be 50 bps increase as well in 2023 and will hold it there. That'll push it towards the 4.75%-5% range.

That said, if economic data doesn't improve halfway through this month going past December, I'm thinking they'll keep pushing rates into Q2 2023 most likely in 25 bps range pushing it over the 5% Fed fund rate point. 

Plan your strategies accordingly and expect a bumpy ride. This latest messaging was less clear with mixed economic data coming. 

TL;DR: Swing trade until mid December data. Expect new bottoms to form some time over the next couple months and then hit capitulation in Q1 2023. Will most likely go sideways for most of 2023 with solid recovery going into Q4.",1.0,6,0,6,question,2022-11-03T00:07:26Z,ykj8cn,t3

Powell agreed there wil at some point be a time to slow rate… however, he confirmed that time is not now and it would be pre-mature… The question that will remain now is was this some unbelievably wild over reaction to what JPOW said or did we just witness the top get put in? There is a case to be made for both that’s for sure.

I took the 389C overnight and that was looking rough for a really long time this morning. Thankfully with the rogue pump before FOMC and then the 2pm pump that was expected I exited for a pretty decent win. Not the best exit but when its moving like that it’s the best you can do for sure. 

That pump also allowed me as expected to exit my now 5dte 386C too for almost 20% win.

I did follow my plan of the 234pm calls. I entered and hit 30% profits pretty much instantly… unfortunately that was where the music stopped playing for me. I fully expected based on movement that we were going to see a really big bullish break out on SPY after the 230 presser as historically has happened. However, it dumped pretty much immediately after I entered. I never saw green again and there was no sense to average down or try to do anything silly. 

If you were okay with small profits it did hit, however, if you weren’t fast it turned into a loss.

Someone asked me last night “why don’t you present a bearish case too?” well until today there wasn’t really a reason to present one. What do I mean by that? Well we had been holding this red bull channel for over 3 weeks now. There was little reason to bet against that until we saw like now a breakdown of that support. 

With SPY now breaking through that green channel support of 378.1 and not only that it also rejected the attempted break through of 388.6 resistance I do favor a bearish case now. With the blue resistance line and red bull channel support line there was also a rising wedge formed that has now broken. 

From here we look at our key levels which will be that 378.1 resistance level. If SPY can break back through there and close over that level tomorrow there actually could be a case made that today was some massive over reaction and we are going to see a reversion to mean break to the upside 385 range tomorrow. However, if we back test and reject 378.1 that is even more confirmation of downside to come. 

If you remember since last CPI the media was screaming a fed pivot and a fed slowing of rate hikes. Overall JPOW effectively just said that is NOT happening right now but in the future will happen. With that narrative now squashed where are we going to go next? The next thing on the Agenda is CPI on November 10th which so far we still do not have a consensus on core or CPI yet. However, monthly CPI is consensus of 0.7 which would be a 0.3% rise over previous MoM. I expect that CPI to release soon and I expect that could absolutely move the markets. 

Key support- 374.6 -&gt; 370.5 -&gt; 365

Key resistance- 378.1 -&gt; 379.9 -&gt; 384.1 -&gt; 388.6

Futures does not look any better then SPY and has broken through the red bull channel support also and landed at 3760 support. This will be the next support that bears what to try to take out. Bulls will look to get this back over 3865 by EOW if they want to remain bullish going forward. 

One major bearish thing we can take away here is that this week effectively was a daily 100ema rejection and now huge break down through daily 8 and 20ema. The bearish case is rising in strength. 

Key support- 3705 -&gt; 3675 -&gt; 3585

Key resistance- 3800 -&gt; 3865 -&gt; 3925

Apple actually was the last domino to fall today and even more interestingly about Apple it has officially broken through the bottom from Friday. That huge green day that Apple had on Friday is now completely gone and then some. 

With this bull channel now broken we are looking at downside obviously now too. It is hard to tell in this picture because if I zoomed out too far it would be hard to see the candles but we are actually seeing quite a bit of red. Looking at the daily you can see that 150.6 is the KEY pivot level of bullish vs. bearish and we are seeing a pretty aggressive rejection of the daily 100 and 200ema which I mentioned earlier would take a few trading days to play out. 

Key support- 144.7 -&gt; 141.1 -&gt; 138.2 

Key resistance- 149.2 -&gt; 150.6 -&gt; 153.4 -&gt; 155.4

They really did massacre my girl Tesla today. I was actually impressively bullish on tesla with that closure over key 230 and the candle body over the daily 20ema which fully closing over the daily 8ema. However, we just saw a pretty massive rejection of the daily 20ema today and closure just above key support at 214.9. 

Key support- 214.9 -&gt; 210 -&gt; 205.6

Key resistance- 219.4 -&gt; 225.8 -&gt; 229.9

What would a -2.5% red day on SPY be without the VIX closing barely green at 0.12%... Well I had imagined they were unwinding the VIX for FOMC and especially for CPI next week, however, I would have expected to see a reaction on the VIX especially with this dump. There is clearly still fear and unknown in this market thanks to JPOW today, however, the VIX didn’t really react. Will it react tomorrow? Or is this going to end up being a straight volume dump with VIX once again being detached? 

Daily log- 

Well I am going to start doing these a little differently! I am going to start a 2.5k 10% take profit/ 20% stop loss challenge. So EOD you will see me post my daily log and post results of a 2.55k challenge. I will probably end up making a separate post for the 2.5k challenge also. For me usually my first trade of the day is my best trade so I will utilize my first entry for the trade. I will use the full $2500 per trade (well as close as I can) and I will update this via Excel like my normal port. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1g4jz5ebqlx91.png?width=828&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05a2491de9d015a29655f9088fa96de3697abc0f

I will start the challenge tomorrow just going to move a few things around in my accounts. Now the thing with this is that it is NOT about full porting… that’s absolutely not what im doing this for and $5000 is not a full port for me. What I am doing instead is hoping to show you guys whether its $500, $1000, $2500, $10,000, etc. etc. If you have proper strategy and risk management and take small profits those small profits will add up over time. This is to show you compound growth. Yes one loss of 20% does set you back two 10% wins, but if you continue to trade the $2,500 it adds up and recovers fairly quickly. 

This is not a full port as I said… I will be utilizing $2,500 PER TRADE so as you see above the starting “balance” is $2,500 but that’s not all that is in there. In the future I may do another one of just one trade a day starting with like $5,000 or something in the account and attempt to grow that… the same premise remains though that as long as you maintain a good strategy one loss really only takes 2-3 trades to over come. With premiums being so ridiculous right now it’s a little hard to use less then $2,500 and even some days $2,500 will be a stretch but like I said it will be as close to $2,500 as it can be. 

I will continue to trade normally in my other account doing day traders/ scalps and of course my level to levels.

Not my best day but not my worse day. The important lesson today was no matter how highly probable a trade is… it can ALWAYS go against you and not only that… it is only a high probability trade if we remember to take profits. These trades that are the “big hitters” have to be lotto size and you have to understand that as you see above there is a chance it goes straight to zero.

9,wallstreetbets,Annual_Equipment_370,self.wallstreetbets,54,I'm pivoting,"Wow, I'm just gonna cash out, delete my brokerage app and forget about fucking stocks forever.  
This week I've accurately used my 3 pre-PDT trades to gain $500 and get rid of this status right before today's shitstorm. I was sitting in cash, 25.2k, just waiting for the FOMC, playing chess and thinking that I'm probably done for today unless market chooses a clear direction after the meeting. Then I see a notification on my phone. YOUR POSITION MAY BE LIQUIDATED.   


wat?  


I opened the app and saw that I'm fucking shorting SQQQ at 52.00 and it's 53.50 now. I forgot to cancel one of the stop orders and went short on margin. I freaked out, tried to cancel the trade via app support and set a buy order at 52.11. Eventually the position was closed at this price and I only lost like $50 on that. And a shitload on neurones.  


After I closed the position, I had a chat with my gf about all the situation, we freaked out, but I felt lucky to escape a potential infinite loss.   


So, happy end, huh? I've evaded PDT status by doing two good trades and dodged this short margin position liquidation.  


Well, after some time I saw a bunch of enormous green dicks on SQQQ chart, realised that market has decided to finally dump and I still can join the trend, bought some SQQQ at 56.00, with default stop loss at 55.00 and profit taker at 57.00. Right after my order was filled, the stonk started to tank. I felt stressed af. It was too much for today and just wanted to exit the trade, fuck off and chill till tomorrow. Instead of closing it with minimal loss, I just watched SQQQ dropped to 55, lost $500, received PDT status, then in half an hour SQQQ jumped to 58, and to 59 in another half an hour. So if I haven't initialised the trade, I would've been +$450 today. If I've sold at a $100 loss, I'd still be fine. If I've managed my stop loss according to volatility, I would've been + extra $1k at close.  


Instead, I'm banned from trading for 90 days. I just watch the market rapidly tanking, feel even more FOMO and self-hatred for being stupid enough to do some emotional trades after such a day and risking my 25k PDT limit. I can't deposit extra money to the account, because my Ukrainian bank doesn't allow me to send USD abroad due to war time restrictions.  


I was waiting for this fucking FOMC and upcoming 52w lows during this whole bullshit rally month, hoping to ride the SQQQ till SPY @ 360. Now I'm fucked, my plan is fucked, finances are fucked. Total loss: $5k. Not as devastating as some of you apes have, but painful enough, and I won't be able to manage this loss in the next 90 days, maybe never, I just feel sick from these fucking candles. Maybe I'll just buy virgin IVW in Feb and maybe will be able to cover my losses in 5 years with the help of cOmPoUnD iNtErEsT. If we won't die in fucking great nuclear war recession till then.

I bought right before the market pump and saw a big red stick on the SQQQ position.  
I held strong and had faith in JPOW.

Also, thanks to JPOW I was able to mitigate my losses on my ABNB FD 90 puts.

# Final Comment

&amp;#x200B;

AMC is a heavily indebted company; the leverage is unsustainable, and the company is struggling to have positive net income. Its Cash Burning Rate is at 2.56, meaning its spending 2.5 times more its cash availability, giving the company a life expectancy of 30 moths with its current cash &amp; cash equivalents. It will need to cash in accounts receivables to extend more its life expectancy.

Income quality dropped drastically since 2018, it means that total earnings do not correspond to the actual cash intake from its operations.

Cash Ration indicate that the company will struggle to pay its current liabilities with its current cash.

Without  a drastic change in its fundamentals, the company is in high risk.

It is advisable to keep an eye on the Company operations and Management Action and evaluate possible adjustments for the final pricing without any changes in trends, the company is destined to die.

Long term forecast is more pessimistic than previously forecasted. 


IMO they will get interest rates close to core inflation and see how much it slows down inflation. Then they may increase it further for a full on recession to bring prices down by killing the economy. 


If core inflation does start going down through Q4 and early 2023, we will see slower rate increases. If stays high, we're going to 6% very fast.

71,wallstreetbets,predictany007,self.wallstreetbets,12,Fed approves 0.75-point hike to take rates to highest since 2008 and hints at change in policy ahead,"The Federal Reserve on Wednesday approved a fourth consecutive three-quarter point interest rate increase and signaled a potential change in how it will approach monetary policy to bring down inflation.

In a well-telegraphed move that markets had been expecting for weeks, the central bank raised its short-term borrowing rate by 0.75 percentage point to a target range of 3.75%-4%, the highest level since January 2008.

The move continued the most aggressive pace of monetary policy tightening since the early 1980s, the last time inflation ran this high.

Along with anticipating the rate hike, markets also had been looking for language indicating that this could be the last 0.75-point, or 75 basis point, move. Specifically, some Fed officials along with Wall Street economists and strategists in recent weeks had talked of a “step-down” in policy that could see a rate increase of half a point at the December meeting and then a few smaller hikes in 2023.

That language was not overt in the post-meeting statement from the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, though there was a tweak that could point to an adjustment in policy.

This week’s statement expanded on previous language simply declaring that “ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate.“

The new language read: “The Committee anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time.“

The statement reiterated that policy changes “will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.“

Markets will look to Chairman Jerome Powell’s news conference at 2:30 p.m. for more clarity on whether the Fed thinks it can implement less restrictive policy that would include a less dramatic level of rate hikes to achieve its inflation goals.

Along with the tweak in the statement, the FOMC again categorized growth in spending and production as “modest” and noted that “job gains have been robust in recent months” while inflation is “elevated.” The statement also reiterated language that the committee is “highly attentive to inflation risks.“

The rate increase comes as recent inflation readings show prices remain near 40-year highs. A historically tight jobs market in which there are nearly two openings for every unemployed worker is pushing up wages, a trend the Fed is seeking to head off as it tightens money supply.

Concerns are rising that the Fed, in its efforts to bring down the cost of living, also will pull the economy into recession. Powell has said he still sees a path to a “soft landing” in which there is not a severe contraction, but the U.S. economy this year has shown virtually no growth even as the full impact from the rate hikes has yet to kick in.

At the same time, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure showed the cost of living rose 6.2% in September from a year ago – 5.1% even excluding food and energy costs. GDP declined in both the first and second quarters, meeting a common definition of recession, though it rebounded to 2.6% in the third quarter largely because of an unusual rise in exports. At the same time, housing prices have plunged as 30-year mortgage rates have soared past 7% in recent days.

On Wall Street, markets have been rallying in anticipation that the Fed soon might start to ease back as worries grow over the longer-term impact of higher rates.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained more than 13% over the past month, in part because of an earnings season that wasn’t as bad as feared but also amid growing hopes for a recalibration of Fed policy. Treasury yields also have come off their highest levels since the early days of the financial crisis, though they remain elevated. The benchmark 10-year note most recently was around 4.04%.

There is little if any expectation that the rate hikes will halt anytime soon, so the anticipation is just on a slower pace. Futures traders are pricing a near coin-flip chance of a half-point increase in December, against another three-quarter point move.

Current market pricing also indicates the fed funds rate will top out near 5% before the rate hikes cease.

The fed funds rate sets the level that banks charge each other for overnight loans, but spills over into multiple other consumer debt instruments such as adjustable-rate mortgages, auto loans and credit cards.

Listen, Zuck MIGHT be an absolute regard and Meta MIGHT be the downfall of his company, but I hardly believe that’s the case. Take VR-chat for example, I have seen lots of people compare meta with vr-chat pointing out that there already is an existing product that currently, beats meta in regards to graphics and so on. But meta was and isnt meant to be like vr-chat. Vr-chat didnt change gaming or gaming trends in basically any shape or form. We still use our systems and most of us would never switch to vr when we have pc and other standard gaming consoles. So why would meta try to create an already existing product, which has proven to not be very successfull? Well I think the answer is simple, they’re not doing that. The massive spending everyone is constantly reffering to is obviously not spent on the graphics or how it ”looks”, but the engine and the software, that currently (as shown by vr-chat), is very underdeveloped. The product isnt and was never meant to be operational or used right now, but everyone seems to think that because of the massive spending, bad graphics and an unfinished product, meta is DOOMED. I believe that there is profound potential in the metaverse because of the massive spendings, not the other way around. People want groundbreaking technology that potentially could represent reality, but act suprised when it turns out the cost of such a system to be built, is massive. Regarded sheep mindset.

Rates in have to be above the rate of inflation. 

For example, if you get a mortgage at current rates, about 7% and the rate of inflation is at 8.1%, you are borrowing money at a rate that is lower than inflation, which is not considered restrictive, or that it is stiil cheaper to borrow vs the appreciation of a commodity or asset.

The dilemma that jpow faces, is the time lag theory, which states that for each rate hike, it takes at minimum 6 months for for it to effect in the economy. The totality of  the effects of the rate hikes will really not be known until mid 2023. So no one really knows what the actual effects of hikes will do.

1.) Core CPI is still high and inflation seems to be sticky

3.) Risk assets have rallied during the last weeks

23,wallstreetbets,ismokenct,self.wallstreetbets,78,Why do people buy Apple so much?,"I'm talking about Apple PRODUCTS

&amp;#x200B;

All apple products are pricey things, including the iPhone, mac, iPad and everything.

Yes they are excellent products with absolutely outstanding performances compared to other products out in the market. Still, yet a LOT of people who buy apple products can save a fortune by picking other products other than the standard MacBook or the iPhone. But yet they have so much market monopoly going on all over the world with such products that will normally be considered quite expensive, to the extent this is almost baffling

&amp;#x200B;

Apple grew AGAIN in the latest quarter
(While all the other major companies mostly had an earnings shock) and I personally think this can only be explained by ""People paying for apple products again and again."" If apple was a growing company aspiring to eat up a lot of the marketplace in the future then the reason for their growth would be pretty obvious. But they're not. It's not like they're starting to insert ads within the ios to increase their revenue. Their one and only source of profit is (mostly) their Apple products. Phones, Laptops, and Tablets that are more than outstanding in quality but also have a significantly higher price tag compared to other products.

It's making people buy the same iPhone again and more (well, not the same but you can still work longer with your previous iPhone.). I don't think Apple would be able to grow this much if people only bought a single iPhone to replace their previous iPhone every three years when their iPhone finally dies.  For some reason they're making the same people buy so much apple products again although their extremely high price tag. Something like buying another iPhone in a shorter span. Or buying other Apple products as well after purchasing your iPhone. Adding a new Macbook in your shopping cart although your previous one is still good.

Seems like people LOVE the iPhone. Yes it's a cult, it's almost something like a new religion

&amp;#x200B;

They don't really have a lot of new customers out there to purchase their first iPhone. Yet the company is still GROWING. A LOT

&amp;#x200B;

Is it the marketing? Is it because of product quality?

&amp;#x200B;

How is the company still GROWING?

&amp;#x200B;

or am i missing something?

25,wallstreetbets,predictany007,self.wallstreetbets,16,Amazon has exited the trillion-dollar club. Sell-off pushes market cap below $1 trillion for first time since April 2020," 

* Amazon’s stock closed down Tuesday for a fifth straight day, falling to the lowest since April 2020.
* Last week the company projected sales in the holiday quarter would be far below expectations.
* The stock dropped 5.9% to $96.79.
* Amazon has exited the trillion-dollar club.

Shares of the e-retailer plunged 5.9% on Tuesday, falling for a fifth straight day and closing at their lowest since April 2020. The sell-off has erased almost all of the stock’s pandemic surge.

Investors continued to punish the company for last week’s disappointing fourth-quarter forecast. Amazon said revenue during the holiday quarter would grow 2% to 8% over the year-ago period, far below analysts’ estimates. The cloud division, Amazon Web Services, also reported weaker-than-expected sales.

It’s the first time Amazon’s market cap has been below $1 trillion since April 2020. The stock has plunged 42% in 2022 and is on pace for its worst year since 2008, when it dropped 45%. The only other year that was worse was during the dot-com crash of 2000, when the company lost 80% of its value.

Like the rest of Big Tech, Amazon has struggled this year due to a slumping economy, soaring inflation and rising interest rates. On top of that, Amazon has been forced to scale back after expanding dramatically during the pandemic, now that consumers have returned to stores.

Amazon has been the second-worst performer in the Big Tech group this year, behind Facebook parent Meta, which has plummeted 72%. Meta told investors last week that revenue in the fourth quarter would likely decline for a third straight period.

Captivating **TL;DR** today - **number go up.** Purchases are u**p 345% ($4.9M to $22M)** from the prior week along with sales, which increased +290% ($263M to $1B). The bulk of purchases stems from insiders at Mobileye Global Inc within the IT sector / Electronic Equipment industry. Active insiders and companies are up 18% and 25% respectively from the prior week.

# High-Level Stats:

* Purchases increased from $4.9M to $22M (+345%)
* Sales increased from $263.5M to $1.02B (+290%)
* Transactions increased from 267 to 316 (+18%)
* Companies represented in Form 4s increased from 170 to 200 (+18%)
   * Net buyers increased from 14 to 23 (+64%)
   * Net sellers increased from 156 to 177 (+13%)
* Insiders filing Form 4s increased from 234 to 292 (+25%)
   * Net buyers increased from 25 to 38 (52%)
   * Net sellers increased from 209 to 254 (+22%)

# Transaction Selection

1. **All** **Direct Open Market Transactions** from **October 24th - October 28th.** These are Form 4 filings with a Transaction Code of “P” or “S”. This narrows the scope to trades where insiders are putting their money on the line.
2. Weekly comparisons are to transactions from **October 17th - October 21st.**
3. **No companies without a ticker** (e.g. opportunity/income/mutual funds).

# Further Context

1. Form 4 data is impacted by a concept known as **backfill** which is par for the course with transactional data. The delay between the Filing Date and the Transaction Date is **\*roughly\*** 2 days and your mileage will vary. This means that **more transactions for past dates can arrive in future filings.** That is why looking at larger trends is key.
2. To combat backfill, filings through this Tuesday are included **\*if\*** the transaction date is from the prior week. Otherwise, transactions from this week are excluded.
3. Data is sourced by the algorithms behind [Form Fore](http://formfore.io/)

# Feedback/Updates

* All feedback, **good bad, and ugly** are welcome - aiming to make these as helpful as possible.
* The **public workbook** should be ready for initial release **sometime next week**. Will also share on Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/FormFore) if that is your preferred hub.
* The newsletter is likely a few weeks out and on my radar. I appreciate your patience!

(TRULIEVE, VERANO, GREENTHUMB, CRESCO, CURALEAF) 

Ontario, Canada-based licensed cannabis producer Canopy Growth’s plans to launch Canopy USA to accelerate its acquisitions of three American marijuana companies and remain listed on a major stock exchange might have provided a blueprint for U.S. companies.

American cannabis operators who touch the plant could follow the Canopy road map to uplist from the Canadian Securities Exchange to the Toronto Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq – provided they’re willing to do a major restructuring, experts told MJBizDaily.

The upside to listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), North America’s third-largest exchange, is that it could help cannabis companies attract more institutional investment.

So far, American plant-touching cannabis companies – such as multistate operators – haven’t been able to raise capital on major exchanges because of the federal illegality of cannabis in the U.S., opting instead to list on the Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE) and over-the-counter markets.

And that might still be a problem, at least for the Nasdaq, which expressed objections to Canopy’s plans and could delist the Smiths Falls-based company.

But the TSX has been more receptive, which could provide U.S. plant-touching operators an avenue for uplisting without waiting for the federal government to legalize marijuana or implement other major cannabis reforms.

In an email to MJBizDaily, Catherine Kee, spokesperson at TSX parent TMX Group, confirmed that Canopy worked directly with the exchange and shared its plans in advance of the announcement.

Kee declined to comment on whether U.S. companies could follow.

“We are aware that legislation applicable to the marijuana sector is evolving,” Kee said. “TMX continues to monitor the developments with interest and we remain committed to supporting the enduring success of the cannabis industry.”

In a note, equity analyst Owen Bennett of New York-based investment bank Jefferies Group wrote that the Toronto Stock Exchange’s approval of a Canopy listing could have major implications for U.S. operators through more M&amp;A by Canadian acquirers and/or enabling “U.S. (operators) to adopt the same structure and uplist to the TSX.”

Restructuring ‘gymnastics’
Kelly Fair – a partner with the international law firm Dentons and external counsel to Canopy’s new holding company Canopy USA – told MJBizDaily she’s proud of the creative approach she and the Canopy team have taken to accelerate U.S. market exposure.

Canopy USA will have a ring-fenced structure in which Canopy Growth would hold nonvoting, exchangeable shares in the holding company, segregating those U.S. assets from the rest of the company.


“To the extent that the substructure is embraced by at least the TSX, then that would provide the opportunity to the U.S. (multistate operators to uplist) potentially sooner than a full legalization event – if they wanted to go through the gymnastics to do structuring like this,” Fair said.

Any MSO looking to uplist would have to create a ring-fenced structure between the listed company and the company that’s actually touching the plant or holding the plant-touching entities, she said.

The pros and cons

Matt Karnes, founder of Greenwave Advisors, told MJBizDaily via email that the TSX is more expensive to list on than the CSE, but that it has more liquidity and more stringent listing requirements – which are both more appealing to institutional investors.

He also said Canopy could try to use TSX approval to pressure the Nasdaq to allow U.S. plant-touching businesses to list.

Another hitch, however, is whether Canopy’s auditors will sign off on consolidated financials that include plant-touching operations in the U.S.

“The Big 4 (accounting firms) have not engaged in U.S. cannabis thus far and this could signal a willingness to accept U.S. cannabis clients – a positive for U.S. cannabis as it gives added assurance to institutional investors as to the industry’s legitimacy,” he said.

Whatever happens, Karnes  believes U.S. multistate operators will follow Canopy’s lead, particularly if they don’t want to wait for legislation such as the Safe and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act that could pass during this lame-duck session of Congress.

“I think whatever path Canopy Growth USA takes, the MSOs will follow, and they don’t necessarily have to wait to see what happens with SAFE.”

39,wallstreetbets,Suspicious-Word-9514,self.wallstreetbets,19,"Macroscope | The Fed meeting preview: 4th 75bps rate-hike is on the way, is pivot coming next?","The Fed's two-day November meeting will end on Wednesday, and the market has well expected its fourth consecutive aggressive 75 basis point rate hike, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. The probability of a 75 basis point rate hike has reached as high as 85.5%, which would raise the federal funds rate to a range of 3.75%-4%, the highest level since 2008.

However, given the recent signals released by the Fed to slow down interest rate hikes, the market is likely to be more concerned about further signals from the Fed after the rate meeting on plans for a December rate hike and the direction of monetary policy next year. The Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has been vocal about the need to slow the pace of interest rate hikes at some point since July, and analysts believe he may also reiterate that point at this meeting. Additionally, a report by the ""New Fed Wire"" last week about the possibility of a slowdown in the Fed's aggressive policy in December continued to gather steam, with medium and long-term US bond yields topping out after hitting yearly highs.

Bloomberg economists said what is less certain is how Powell will communicate a potential future downshift in the rate-hike pace -- the degree of conviction, the risks around hike sizing, and implications for the terminal rate. Economists expect Powell to use 50 basis points present a 50-basis-point move as the base case and clarify that a downshift in the pace of rate hikes does not necessarily mean a lower terminal rate.

It is worth noting that the Fed’s November meeting is also just less than a week before the US mid-term elections. Undoubtedly, how to deal with the Republicans on the high-rise inflation and the risk of recession will become a major problem for Biden. And just last week, two Democratic senators urged Powell not to cause unnecessary pain by over-raising interest rates.

It has been said that there are now major divergences within the Fed on monetary policy. For example, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daley thinks the Fed should start discussions on slowing down rate hikes to avoid sending the economy into an ""unforced slump"". But Kansas Fed President Esther George believes that monetary policy needs to move into a restrictive range, and the strength remains to be watched. Given the recent volatility in the financial markets and the time it takes for interest rate hikes to affect the economy, the Fed cannot act too hastily.

There are also a few views that do not favour a pivot. Fed governor Michelle Bowman hopes to look for signs of falling inflation before slowing down the rate hike. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said he hopes to raise the policy rate to a level that would put meaningful downward pressure on inflation.

Therefore, for this meeting, FOMC members are expected to engage in a heated debate on how to steer interest rates to avoid a troubled economy.

“They may want to go slower just in the interest of financial stability,” said Julia Coronado, the founder of MacroPolicy Perspectives LLC. “It’s a challenge for messaging because they don’t want to ease financial conditions significantly. They need tight financial conditions to keep cooling the economy off. So he (Powell) doesn’t want to sound dovish, but he may want to go slower.”

Some institutions took a relatively cautious view. Nomura believes that the FOMC does not yet seem to have a consensus on the preferred size of a December rate hike, which will limit Powell's ability to provide guidance. The Fed chairman will reiterate that future policy will depend on economic data, including the two non-farm payrolls reports and, most importantly, the latest inflation data. Barclays also released a report saying that the Fed may leave its December policy options open, pending more information on inflation and tightening risks.

The [J.P. Morgan](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NYSE-JPM/) team, on the other hand, made relatively “accurate “predictions on the outcome of this meeting. Analysts believe the most likely scenario going to happen is a 75 basis point rate hike and a hawkish press release, which could allow Powell to retain selectivity for December and next year meetings, while highlighting the current risks of higher inflation. In this scenario, S&amp;P 500 may float between down 1% to up 0.5%. And if the Fed provides clear guidance for the December meeting, this is likely to be seen as dovish and S&amp;P 500 could rise by 2.5%-3%.

In addition, former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers also tweeted recently, saying that the “growing chorus” for the Fed to pause interest rate hikes very soon is “badly misguided.” In his view, the Fed should stick to its current course and not pause too soon, especially given that it has a history of “past errors”.

Aside from rate hikes, let's not forget the glooming recession hanging over the US. Concerns were fuelled last week by the inversion in the 3-month/10-year US bond yields. Prior to this, the 2/10-year US bond inversion had been going on for almost five months. Given the historically extremely high success rate of both yield curves in predicting crisis, there is growing concern about how the Federal Reserve will respond to outside concerns about the economy.

Notably, Jerome Powell had said in the press conference after the September meeting that the goal of fighting inflation had not changed and would be maintained until the task completed, and the federal funds rate would need to be kept at a restrictive level for a certain time. But the FOMC had already revised down the US economic growth rate to 0.2% this year.

It is worth noting that while consumers, the engine of the US economy, are still maintaining spending in the face of inflationary pressures, danger signals are beginning to reveal. The US Department of Commerce said last week that consumer spending growth slowed to a near two-year low of 1.4% from 2.0% in the previous quarter, and consumer purchasing power continues to retreat at a 3% rate and US families are gradually running out of federal financial subsidies in the COVID pandemic.",0.79,11,0,11,question,2022-11-02T14:27:47Z,yk3wmu,t3

54,wallstreetbets,asmit10,self.wallstreetbets,4,$CCJ - Uranium Miner trying to break out of a 8 year downtrend,"$CCJ

Camerco claims:

Uranium inventories are low

Secondary supply is low

Nobody has been investing in supply

‘never started a cycle with this high of a uranium price’

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Camerco appears to be a good steward of capital and understands the market dynamics involved with being a supplier of a not-so-rare mineral

Camerco had \~10% of world uranium production in 2021

China adding \~150 nuclear power plants by 2035

China’s nuclear power generation in the past 10 years has been so great - that it has made up for Europe’s staunch stance on decommissioning - leading to the largest nuclear power plant power generation of all time in 2021. It is conceivable that the west is beginning to realize their mistake and are beginning the process of fixing it, out of necessity from Russia’s and Saudi Arabia’s oil cartel.

Yes, oil manufacturing is going to spike. Oil supply will eventually outpace demand, the Russian war will end, and energy prices will stabilize…but with China investing so much into low-cost energy, will the west want to remain dependent on Russia for economic stability?

Even the most anti-nuclear governments are temporarily halting their decision to decommission 30 year old plants

200 - 400 nuclear power plants to be decommissioned by 2040

Camerco recently announced a deal to buy Westinghouse..

…and Poland just announced they’re building their first nuclear power plant and chose the U.S. and Westinghouse to build their first Nuclear Power Plant.

According to [World-nuclear.org](https://World-nuclear.org): 

About 90 power reactors with a total gross capacity of about 90,000 MWe are on order or planned, and over 300 more are proposed. Most reactors currently planned are in Asia, with fast-growing economies and rapidly-rising electricity demand.

&amp;#x200B;

Major uranium miners are seeing a demand increase in Uranium out to 2024 - and are subsequently significantly increasing production, including Camerco

Many western governments have started initiatives to support nuclear initiatives

Last quarter financial results showed negative earnings because they wrote off the expanse of restarting a mine. They previously shut the mine off due to poor uranium market performance.

Their main competitor is also increasing uranium production. They are both doing so based on contracts they’ve obtained and plan to obtain - neither seem to participate in the spot market in a material way.

&amp;#x200B;

Technically speaking, $CCJ has begun trying to break out of a major downtrend going back to 2014.

$CCJ Reiterated multiple times that they see strong profit going forward, and see production along with spot rates increasing. Given this, the Russian - Saudi oil regime, China's emergence as the nuclear energy super power, a massive reversal in short-term power plant decomissioning, the global incentive to go nuclear (Low long term cost, removal of complete reliance on oil, 'going green'), and  the material fact that Western governments have begun to spend money supporting this thesis...

&amp;#x200B;

Do you guys have any thoughts?

&amp;#x200B;

I'll leave with a headline I found:

Article dated: 6 Oct 2022

# No nuclear power ‘renaissance’ as Europe wrestles energy crisis

""...But after eight months of fighting in Ukraine, and an energy crisis compounded most recently by the alleged sabotage of the arterial Nord Stream 1 and 2 Russia-to-Europe pipelines in the Baltic Sea, European governments long opposed to nuclear power have shown only incremental shifts in their attitudes, which have been informed by years of concerns about nuclear waste and safety.

&amp;#x200B;

A wider pivot has remained absent.

&amp;#x200B;

“We’re not talking about a nuclear renaissance, as such,” Nicolas Berghmans, an energy and climate expert at the France-based Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations (IDDRI), told Al Jazeera, “but maybe more of a change of tide.”

&amp;#x200B;

“A real nuclear renaissance would be if Europe decides to invest in more nuclear power plants.”""",0.83,8,0,8,dd,2022-11-02T10:50:05Z,yjzuta,t3

Just a quick edit: [M2 Money Stock over the last 60 years](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL)

u/Infamous_Sympathy_91 's [post on credit card debt and personal savings from earlier today](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yjowp1/us_personal_savings_near_historic_lows/)


In 2020 money stopped moving. I wrote this in some of my previous posts and comments. In order to prop up economic activity, central banks increased money supply with almost 0 interest a.k.a Brrrrrr.

So ideally fresh minted money is distributed in the real economy and moves up and trickles down and so forth. As you can see in the chart above, money hasn't been moving as much in the economy since the peak in 2000; It's in constant decline with a hard fall in 2020.

Today central banks are trying to battle inflation. As you can see in the chart above, money isn't moving as much, so it's not that there is too much money in the real economy. Whatever they printed in the last 2 years went up to the big black void of finance. All the derivatives market, swaps, trenches and all sorts of made up bullshit has sucked up money faster than your wife sucking her boyfriend's cock.

Inflation is a product of price gauging and artificial crises, such as cutting down oil production, slowing down logistics around the globe, lagging or harsh response to the pandemic by governments etc.

What you're seeing with the interest rate increases will only hit small businesses and working people. Casino always wins. Banks will own everything. You will own nothing at the end of this.

In the next two years, you will lose your jobs, you will lose your homes if you have debt. You will start selling your assets until capitalism owns your ass. We had reached a point of multi-generational wealth with too many high net worth individuals. Those who are pulling the strings are actively sabotaging the economy and are robbing you.

The interest rates will once again go down, when most people lose everything and you can't borrow anymore. This isn't about bringing the inflation down by decreasing money spent in real economy. The chart in the link clearly shows you that there is no increased activity which would increase velocity of money.

So tomorrow or in the next year don't get your hopes up too much. Your average working class ape is in more debt than before and savings are at an all time low. The latest surge in house prices also guaranteed that banks and through them the central banks owns you.

This is the final stage of capitalism. Good luck to you all.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%. (Stats as of 2022-10-28)",0.8,12,0,12,dd,2022-11-02T03:10:54Z,yjr9oh,t3

So you like to make money fast? Is your motto Lambo or food stamps? This it’s for you. At 2 PM ET FOMC announcement made. A large price movement occurs at this time , this movement creates a fair gap value , as Powell starts to speak at 2:30 ET a counter move starts to test price movement created at release of hike announcement occurs. This can easily 2x-4x your 0 dte SPY option if it goes well if it doesn’t you lose 100% of your initial gamble I mean investment. This same pattern has occurred for the last two years . It doesn’t guarantee that it will happen again. Risky scalp with large potential for profit/losses. Just to reiterate if price has a large move up at 2 pm ET than just before 2:30 ET buy puts, if price has a large move down at 2 pm ET than just before 2:30 ET buy calls . This strategy has become rather popular in discord channels/twitter. No positions at the moment as strategy needs to be executed at FOMC.",0.7,4,0,4,dd,2022-11-02T01:46:07Z,yjpc8o,t3

12,wallstreetbets,DaddyDersch,self.wallstreetbets,48,"11-1-22 SPY/ ES Futures, Apple and Tesla Daily TA","It was the night before FOMC and all through the markets there was oddities… I had mentioned last night actually in my TA that I expect at some point markets were going to get shocked by a big drop intraday instead of this recovery rip… that day was today. 

The interesting thing about today is that VOLD (volume) actually came in bullish at open and through the whole day pretty much until right before power hour VOLD was actually in extreme bull momentum. Now SPY could not break out and break away from 385 level. The thoughts are we either watched markets be held up by volume or there was just some weird stuff going on today. There was some dark pool prints hitting the tapes again today. 

The other interesting thing that I noted today is that this is the first time that the day before FOMC the VIX has been red (and especially didn’t spike) since the June FOMCs. The last two FOMCs were the first with a spike of the VIX the day before. 

What does that mean ? well im not quite sure but those months of FOMC were more bullish. 

&amp;#x200B;

We also have quite a few articles released today saying that Biden supports a pivot of the fed (this was later slightly walked back though). 

My initial thoughts on what to expect tomorrow is that JPOW drops a 75bps (I would be SHOCKED to see a 50bps) but then he should hint at a “we will remain data dependent but there is a case to slow hikes if we continue to see optimism and to fully evaluate the effects of rate hikes.” 

But tomorrow will be interesting to say the least!

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ig9cg0t6hex91.png?width=773&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=358cc3b9af8b4e8c28541c1fa6b63f0f176b3cad

This TA is going to be pretty brief as markets gonna move however the algos want it to with FOMC. 

But overall we did attempt to breakout over 390.1 resistance of the green channel. With that pretty stout rejection we are not finding support which we did find almost all day at 385. This could if we get a green day tomorrow also be seen as a nice daily 8ema/ 50ema support test. In addition I am seeing that the 8ema is crossing back over the 50ema (bullishly) for the first time in two months. 

The rejection at 390.1 also was a rejection of the daily 100ema which im not super surprised by as this level is usually a bigger fight. Markets will need the push from good FOMC news tomorrow to break through these key levels and breakout until CPI. 

Key support- 380.1 -&gt; 377.8 -&gt; 374.1

Key resistance- 388.6 -&gt; 390.1 -&gt; 393 -&gt; 397.8 (my potential target for a bullish FOMC)

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9bgssm97hex91.png?width=805&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9783ca967b5792443220149d07832cbaa52a8ad0

Looking at futures we have actually had this pattern play out just last week where we found support and managed to push up for an extreme green day. 

With a rejection of that 200ema today and that 3925 level that will remain key resistance and we will look for that level to be closed over tomorrow to continue to be bullish. 

Key support- 3845 -&gt; 3800

Key resistance- 3885 -&gt; 3925 -&gt; 3975

Apple has nearly retraced all the way back to where it was Friday before that massive rip on earnings. I wish I woulda been smart enough to short it Friday at market close. Apple was able to back test and hold the daily 8/50ema support lines today, however fell and closed under the 100/200ema. 

Key support- 148 -&gt; 146

Key resistance- 153.4 -&gt; 155.7 -&gt; 157.4

Tesla actually had a pretty nice pop today and broke through (but failed to close over) a key level. I was mentioning as you can see that 205 to 230 red channel on tesla. With this break through I am actually looking at an upside move on tesla (despite FOMC). 

This is its first time its broken through key 230 resistance since October 7th. We still have not closed over 230 though but as long as tesla holds over its daily 8ema and continues to hold this red bull channel I will remain bullish on it. 

Key support- 230 -&gt; 224.8 -&gt; 219.2

Key resistance- 234.2 -&gt; 239.6

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mmpr6qc9hex91.png?width=503&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58c636921894dc187d9689ff9e4c84edfd019809

As I had mentioned this is the first FOMC since June that the VIX has not popped significantly the day before. To me this means markets are bullish. I think that anything super hawkish for the FOMC tomorrow especially if he says 75bps in December the VIX is going to spike like no other and we could very well end up with a huge red day. However, I remain bullish and I think JPOW wont say anything to tip the markets down tomorrow. 

10% challenge-

Overall today was yet again another untradeable day after the first big move. Was able to get some nice scalps in today. And with an average down on my SPY and Tesla puts this morning at open I was able to close the SPY level to level puts for green and close the Tesla level to level puts for a smaller loss (they were very red at open). I don’t like DCAing to win a play like that but I didn’t expect that massive pre-market and with SPY holding under and beginning to dump off the key 390.1 resistance at open I felt confident in the DCA.

TLDR for my fellow apes:

\- A scientist started mapping multiple countries' claimed economic growth numbers to the increase in city lights seen from satellites

\- He found a high correlation between the two in democratic countries that had a free press and independent parties measuring the numbers

\- He found a large discrepancy between the two in autocratic regimes that controlled the reporting agencies and the press (shocker!)

\- Tested his theory against reasons why totalitarian countries might have fewer lights when experiencing massive economic growth (hey! they like working and living in the dark! They're allergic to electricity! They care more about the environment!). Nothing seemed to stand up to scrutiny.

\- Based on the growth in lights, he estimates that China's growth was less than half what they claimed. This means that China's GDP is likely less than half of the US rather than nearly equal

\- The other side of the coin is that their total debt levels might be between 600-700% of GDP rather than 300%

\- Paper has been peer-reviewed and presented at multiple economic conferences

I know it's pretty mind-blowing to think China might actually lie about something like this given their honest and transparent dealings to date but you have to admit the science is pretty spiffy.",0.87,390,0,390,news,2022-11-01T22:09:25Z,yjjsm5,t3

TLDR- we could go higher but we have more uncertainty in the near future as opposed to the last 2 weeks.

Some important dates to keep in mind:

Nov. 2nd- FOMC day

Nov. 10th- Oct. CPI data

Cant post the chart cus VisualMod keeps on taking it down.

Simple as seeing the last bear market rally and then applying it to now. We saw a rising wedge form on the monthly chart which is happening now. If the fed says it will indeed be ""kinder and gentler"" in any way shape or form you better bet your bottom dollar we will go to 408. However, on the off chance, the Fed says it will continue to bring more pain all your calls will be worthless in a few days. Now keep in mind that Oct. CPI will also determine if we continue to keep going higher even after a Fed ""pivot"". If CPI comes in hot we could see a similar drop back down to 350.

My plan- Wait till FOMC to see if the fed is indeed going to be kinder and gentler. If so buy $400 calls then take out my initial before CPI and if CPI is hot buy $360 puts.",0.64,7,0,7,dd,2022-11-01T21:44:03Z,yjj173,t3

**price\_efficiency:** how much are you losing to the bid/ask spread? Higher number the better. 

**expected\_move:** this is a percentage of the expected move, as priced by the ATM calls and puts, for this stock by expiration date (this Friday)

How to use this in your trading? 

Do you think **DASH** will move more than 14% by Friday? If not, sell options. If you think it will move for than that, I guess you might want to go long (debit) an option (not recommended). 

Do you want to trade **INTC**? Notice how the put\_IV is double that of calls. That means traders are bidding up the puts, and bidding down the calls relative to each other. If you think its going up, sell those puts and buy the calls. 

Want to trade **SBUX**? Realize that you will lose roughly 2% immediately when filling your trade and another 2% immediately when you exit. This is how the bid/ask spread works.

* The comments do not necessarily signal any pending actions against TikTok.
* The Treasury and Justice Departments are the ones leading a review and negotiations with the company.

Shares of U.S. social media companies Snap and Meta spiked on the news that a Federal Communications Commissioner said the U.S. government should ban TikTok.

“I don’t believe there is a path forward for anything other than a ban,” Republican Commissioner Brendan Carr told Axios in an interview.

Snap shares were up 6% and Meta shares were up 4% Tuesday afternoon.

The comments from Carr, one of four current commissioners at the Democrat-led agency, do not necessarily signal any pending actions against TikTok.

The Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS) in the Treasury Department is reviewing the company’s potential national security implications, given its ownership by a Chinese company, ByteDance. And the Department of Justice is the one leading negotiations over a security deal, The New York Times reported in September.

Concerns over TikTok’s potential security risks are generally bipartisan. Both the Trump and Biden administrations have expressed concerns and reviewed the company’s relationship with its Chinese owner. TikTok has maintained that it stores U.S. user data outside of China so that it would not have to turn over that information to the government, but U.S. officials have maintained their skepticism.

“Commissioner Carr has no role in the confidential discussions with the U.S. government related to TikTok and appears to be expressing views independent of his role as an FCC commissioner,” a TikTok spokesperson said a statement.

79,wallstreetbets,predictany007,self.wallstreetbets,38,President Biden to float windfall tax on U.S. energy producers. Do you think it will affect energy stocks?," 

* Shares of refiners, oil producers drop after news report
* AP reported windfall tax is being considered by White House

President Joe Biden will call on Congress to consider tax penalties for oil and gas companies accruing record profits, according to a White House official, amid stubbornly high gasoline prices that are dragging on Democrats’ midterm prospects.

This could include a so-called windfall profit tax -- which Democrats have been proposing for more than a decade without success. The idea has renewed attention among progressives in Congress after gasoline prices spiked to more than $5 a gallon this summer.

Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat and Biden ally who chairs the tax-writing Finance Committee, has floated a proposal that would impose a new federal surtax on oil companies that record a profit margin better than 10%.

The White House official didn’t confirm that Biden would specifically call for the windfall tax after AP reported earlier Monday that he would. Biden will press oil and gas companies to invest their profits in lowering costs for Americans, the official said.

The president is scheduled to deliver remarks Monday afternoon, according to the White House, on “reports over recent days of major oil companies making record-setting profits even as they refuse to help lower prices at the pump for the American people.”

Biden also could reiterate his request for Congress to eliminate a slew of tax incentives enjoyed by the industry, including a deduction of intangible drilling costs, which allows oil and gas companies to immediately deduct some expenses, such as labor, site preparation and repairs.

Administration officials have weighed a number of other steps to encourage oil refiners to keep more gasoline and diesel inside the US, instead of exporting it, as domestic stockpiles shrink ahead of winter. New restrictions on the export of finished fuels, including diesel, could be imposed administratively.

Oil industry trade groups have argued a windfall tax would penalize domestic energy and fuel production right when the US should be encouraging more of both.

“Rather than taking credit for price declines and shifting blame for price increases, the Biden administration should get serious about addressing the supply and demand imbalance that has caused higher gas prices and created long-term energy challenges,” American Petroleum Institute President and Chief Executive Officer Mike Sommers said in a statement.

“Today, the president is proposing to raise taxes on the U.S. natural gas and oil industry that is competing globally to produce the fuels Americans need every single day.”

The S&amp;P 500 Energy Index initially erased a 2% gain after the news broke but partially recovered trading up 0.9% at 2:04 p.m. in New York. Refining stocks led the declines.

The Biden proposal resembles measures that politicians across Europe, and in some other countries such as India, are imposing on companies reaping record profits from fossil fuels and power generation. Mostly, those governments are using cash raised from windfall taxes to help subsidize soaring energy bills for households.

Critics of such plans say they’ll deter companies from making the kind of investments that are crucial for increasing supply, and keeping prices down, in the future -- a charge that may have more traction in the US, which unlike most European countries is itself a major oil and gas producer.

The hilarious thing is,. even after Cineworld pulled out bc of pandemic stuff, Cineplex is back trying to buy the US side of the market. If anyone knows cineworld has value, it's gotta be Cineplex - though they are for sure just trying to get cheap assets from a struggling Cineworld

According to the SEC’s order, Compass repeatedly assured investors in 2017 that a technology upgrade at its Goderich mine – the world’s largest underground salt mine which is located near Ontario, Canada, and hailed by the company as its crown jewel – was on track to materially reduce costs and boost its operating results starting in 2018. **Compass’s statements were misleading because they failed to tell investors that costs at the mine were increasing rather than decreasing, which substantially undermined the projected savings.** The SEC also found that Compass misled investors by overstating the amount of salt it was able to produce at Goderich.

The SEC’s order found that Compass violated the antifraud, reporting, and internal controls provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and various related rules.

Instead, there are some old companies more than 100 years old that are worth looking at as investors are looking for opportunities in quality “old” companies.

## 1. [EQT Corporation (EQT)](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NYSE-EQT/)

EQT which was founded in 1888, is one of the oldest stocks. The majority of analysts (77%) are bullish on the energy company, and they expect the stock to rally 56% from there. Analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a report last month that ETO-Top's risk-reward setup was the ""best"" among its peers heading into the winter this year.

As Europe’s gas price skyrocketing for the year and oil price globally has risen substantially this year due to the war in Russia and Ukraine providing tight supply. Europe could be headed for tough winters for the next 10 years and the supply shortages are likely the keep natural gas prices on a volatile upswing. The EQT should be benefited from tight supply and strong demand from Europe.

## 2. [General Motors (GM)](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NYSE-GM/)

General Motors was founded in 1908 and has a buy rating from 62.5% of analysts. At the current price, the stock is expected to rise 25.7%. General Motors comfortably beat earnings expectations last week, but revenue was slightly below expectations and it maintained its full-year outlook. Either way, GM reported profits a full 20 percent higher than expected, triggering the rally in GM shares. The stock rose 3.6% on earnings day and is up 6.8% in the three trading days since the results were released.

TDLR: this pump was fueled by Japanese QE, White House is increasing inflation along with Japanese. Fed will be more aggressive to win, we all know the fed don’t lose




so everyone n their mother thinks we’re up because “pivot rumors” reality is when the pivot news dropped, market went green for a few minutes then shat the bed and ran red. then a certain something happened that made us run green and started this rally. It was BOJ interventions. BOJ (bank of Japan) dumped a whopping 40-50 billion dollars that morning so they can save the collapsing yen. Granted they were and partially still in denial about the whole interference as far as I can tell but they do assure y’all that they are “monitoring the markets” and they balance sheet keeps shrinking at a rather rapid pace.

So far off my estimates (too lazy to go pull up balance sheet) but I believe it’s around 200 billion that they have dumped into the markets since “bottom” was in. to put this into perspective, QT is burning slightly under 100bil a month and these guys just wiped out 2 months worth of hard effort and pain that the fed was trying to inflict in around 3 weeks time.

And there’s no sign of them stopping….. 

Their balance sheet is slightly over a trillion so they can keep this going on for a while.


THE CONSPIRACY

This whole operation along with “pivot” rumors are all well too damn coordinated. First off, we won’t see a pivot, CORE cpi was flaming hotter than Japanese pornstars. core PCE while came under estimates; it is still rising and there’s no sign of slowdown. So ask me again, why would they pivot or even hint at a pivot? 
It’s well known the White House has been begging Powell to go easy this meeting because of the election and u bet Powell is not being swayed. If politics were to get involved Powell is a republican and he’s on his last term so if anything he’s delivering more pain. But we all know Powell is here for the American people so I think he’s just gonna do what he had already planned and that is to just do his job and crush inflation. This is his chance to go down in history like Volker did. So I think the White House likley phoned the Japanese and begged them to dump dollars or someshit idk but this was all too well coordinated of a pump. The treasury(White House) is issuing an extra 150bil in debt above estimates. They are all adding to inflation trying to counteract the fed ahead of the elections.


this is why even if Powell had 75bps planned he will be forced to go with 100bps. They can’t increase QT since it’s really very close to max in terms of liquidity drain vs bank reserves. leaving the only option as more aggressive hikes to fight off the democrats and Japanese coordinated attacks against the fed. 


I think even with 100bps it’ll take some time to bleed the Japanese dry if they keep fighting so we can go on for months green if BOJ is willing to drop all 1 trillion that it has but I’m pretty certain they’ll stop once the election ends cuz it is coordinated after all to just spoof the markets for better votes in favor of the democrats",0.75,35,0,35,question,2022-11-01T13:37:05Z,yj6djm,t3

There’s one inflation gauge that bucks the trend

The New York Fed’s often overlooked UIG believes US inflation is past its peak


Whenever there’s an economic consensus on anything, it’s worth considering how it might be wrong. There seems to be general agreement that inflation and rates will be higher for longer, and “team transitory” has been defeated. But what if we are at an inflection point on inflation? This is the question policymakers should be asking. By one key measure, inflation in the US has already peaked. In fact, it peaked in March, the same month that the Federal Reserve began raising the benchmark rate.

The New York Fed’s underlying inflation gauge has largely been ignored for decades. That’s understandable, and not just because of the snoozer of a name. There wasn’t any significant underlying inflation in the years after the global financial crisis. While the Fed and financial markets are fixated on the 2 per cent inflation target, the UIG isn’t primarily a level forecast. Its real value is in predicting inflection points. It correctly anticipated the lasting high inflation we are now observing. And while it’s still high, the UIG is suggesting it will be abating.

The media and the public are obsessed with the consumer price index, while the Fed’s target is based on the personal consumption expenditures index. Both can be “noisy”, since they include the prices of volatile items such as energy and food. But they are not the only price measures. The Atlanta Fed tracks nine other indices(opens a new window) for inflation that aim to strip out noise. They show inflation somewhere between 4.7 and 7.3 per cent in September.

Most of these gauges remove data to try to identify underlying inflation. Core CPI excludes energy and food costs, for example, while trimmed mean and median measures strip out components with the largest changes in prices to smooth out the index. But the risk with these indices is that they can miss large price moves — up or down — that could be a signal of inflation changing direction.

The UIG is constructed differently, removing noise rather than items from the index. The idea is that movements in trend inflation happen alongside related changes in the trends of other economic and financial factors. The index looks at moves in prices, the labour market, financial markets and the real economy every month and checks the historical data going back to 1995 to see if similar moves had previously lasted at least a year. If so, they are included in that month’s UIG and if not, they are filtered out as noise.

You really can’t use the UIG to forecast the level of inflation, as has sometimes been suggested(opens a new window). Where it matters is in showing when the inflation trend is changing, and on this it has a decent track record in both normal and unprecedented times. When CPI hit a peak in 2018, for example, UIG clearly showed the peak while core CPI and trimmed mean and median indices suggested inflation would continue rising. In mid-2009, UIG showed a trough in inflation while the other measures took another year to reach a nadir.
What about during the pandemic? Core CPI did a good job of signalling a bottom for inflation in mid-2020 before rising, but dipped in the third quarter last year, wrongly suggesting that inflation would come down. The trimmed mean and median inflation indices failed to indicate a shift towards higher inflation, showing a trough more than six months after CPI and core CPI.

UIG found a bottom roughly in line with headline CPI and then started a steady climb upwards, rightly ignoring the slump in the third quarter of 2021. Of these metrics, it provided the earliest and most reliable signal for a rise in underlying inflation.

The Fed is now looking for signs that trend inflation has peaked and that monetary tightening is bringing inflation back towards its target. Much to its alarm, core inflation dipped in the second quarter of this year before accelerating in August and September. Median and trimmed mean inflation have been on a steady upward climb, with no signs of stabilisation. But the UIG peaked in March 2022, stabilised at high levels and has been gradually falling since July.

All the different gauges for inflation suggest it is way above the Fed’s target. But we know monetary policy works with long and variable lags, and there is a danger overtightening could spark a recession. The central bank aims to look through transitory factors and set policy based on the underlying trend. The UIG shows the trend is finally starting to reverse course. With rates now restrictive, that suggests it’s time for Fed officials to consider slowing their tightening path.

**The top 2 challenges  and why they are going in favour of Bayer** 

**1) litgations 2) europe economy**

**European economy and the rise of the germans** 

**The dark winter**
- we all know European is heading into a difficult winter, although energy prices have gone down since i write this, it is no guarantee they will remain so. However, the germans are going to spend there way out of this winter and are poised to avoid a recession in 2023.

*it has already begun*

Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase. 



1) winter recession avoided 

https://m.ca.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/germany-dodges-recession-but-inflation-climbs-to-116-2811016

Why will it benefit the underlying stock? 

Spending - stocks go up in spending times bud. 

2) surprising growth,  will it be enough to outpace inflation ?  For 2023  Germany is likely to be okay, and Bayers product are essentials, during hard times Bayer makes money as well.

https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/short_news/germany-under-fire-for-canibalistic-e200-billion-investment/

3) relief plan makes  the EU  worried, if Germany avoid recession by spending, other European nations will want to follow the idea,  inflation cannot be controlled like this. EU therefore sounds the alarm and potential consequences, it is likely that not too many nations will follow suit in my opinion , Germany can afford to be spending, not many  European nations can, making Germany the exception, in fact if Germany being the biggest economy in Europe  makes it through, much of Europe will also make I through. 

The worried citi suggest the following 

*The proposals could cut 2 percentage points off inflation in the next year, according to Citi, but they are unlikely to prevent an economic contraction. The package “may soften the coming recession but also poses risks, in our view,” Citi analysts said in a note released last Friday.*

Why are we using words like economic contraction  all of a sudden instead of recession?

- **The litigations over roundup** and *glysophate*


 Bayer is still facing litigations due to the acquisition of Monsanto and RoundUp and during the last earnings call, Werner Baumann gave updated numbers. There are about 141,000 claims in total and about 108,000 have been settled.

Remember they have already set the cash aside, have won or litigated the majority of all cases. The rest are likely to head the same path.

Here is glysophate  surging 300% in 2021 https://www.agweb.com/news/crops/crop-production/glyphosate-prices-soar-much-300-and-thats-if-you-can-even-get-it

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king: 

Take a look at some of these charts in the past 59 years  have crop production globally  ever decreased over time ? Never, ever.

lawsuit:
Counter point and what investors should know :


For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic. This includes recent conclusions by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the EU’s Assessment Group on Glyphosate (AGG), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), and the leading health authorities in Germany, Australia, Korea, Canada, New Zealand, and Japan.

https://www.bayer.com/en/roundup-litigation-five-point-plan

One of Bayer's core defenses in the litigation is that the EPA has decided glyphosate is not carcinogenic and not a risk to public health.",0.76,6,0,6,dd,2022-11-01T03:00:59Z,yiuf5p,t3
40,wallstreetbets,illikwid,self.wallstreetbets,25,How to trade 0dte options on FOMC Wednesday - A Regard's Perspective,"PHASE 0: 9:30-1:59:59

&amp;#x200B;

trading rangebound af.  0dtes swinging +/-10% on pure delta.  theta is frozen.  buy puts on your preferred index/etf at any time.  depending on your risk tolerance and the underlying, open a limit sell order for 1.5x-3x.  pussy with spy itms? get ur +50%.  lunatic on some otm spx? go for that +200% in 5 minutes u fucking god.

&amp;#x200B;

PHASE 1: 2:00:00-2:05 

 

i dont even wanna talk about what to do if its not 75bps but just in case...

100bps: do some sick euphoric dance and start howling.  then remember u set a limit order and lose your mind as you watch your 1.5x turn into free millionaire tickets.

50bps: cry and hope jpow starts levitating and speaking in tongues.  or maybe ur a maniac with a 4100 spx call hedge in case jpow starts handing out bags of cash instead of having a press conference.

&amp;#x200B;

75bps:

instant sentiment analysis on fomc statement finds ""pivot language"" to be largely absent.  spy down 1% in seconds, maybe making it all the way to -2%. your low-return sell order goes off in 10 seconds.  you clench and maybe walk around in a circle for 5 minutes.  your longer shots sell.

&amp;#x200B;

PHASE 2: 2:05-2:33  

&amp;#x200B;

conflicting narratives enter the picture.  the gamma recedes.  hopefully you're back in cash.  maybe you're in shambles cuz ur greedy limit just had its balls tickled.  we catch our breath and say, 'hold on, lets see what pow pows gonna say.  why are we down?  it was 75bps like everyone predicted.  that was priced in.  that was an overreaction, grab up this discounted shit quick.'  

market churns and claws back some to all of phase 1 losses.  pow pow takes his sweet ass time walking up to the podium and clears his throat...

&amp;#x200B;

PHASE 3: 2:34-2:4X

&amp;#x200B;

i dont know really. probably not much happens.  powell on his prepared remarks.  maybe he throws a hawkish jab or two, or sprinkles some grass for the bulls. hold on to ur cash.

&amp;#x200B;

PHASE 4: 2:4X-EOD

&amp;#x200B;

this is where we set momentum into jobs on friday.  powell opens some q+a.  first q probably some random bullshit that pow pow deflects heroically.  then maybe another softball, maybe a few more.  then some legendary lunatic reporter grabs the mic and says, 'YO JEROME YOU FUCKING PIVOTING OR WHAT?' powell takes a moment to collect himself, then states with volume and conviction we shall not pivot.  

now we're at another crossroads.  i'd say market starts selling right the fuck off.  but maybe, just maybe, we irrational bastards are so impressed by jpows stalwart leadership that we collectively decide an economy helmed by such a man must be infallible and head off towards the moon.

you could be in position before this pivotal (fuck you) line of questioning, hoping to predict the market reaction or do a spread if ur into that shit.  or you could wait a few minutes after jpow drops the mic for the direction to become clear and jump on it.  we're not changing direction til mid thursday at the earliest.  i wouldnt even call you a pussy if you bought a thurs / fri exp instead at this point and sold it late on thurs.  if you go with a 0 day roll that shit sometime 3:30-EOD.  

at least 3 percent up or down close on wed and an additional 1-3% move in the same direction on thursday.  

&amp;#x200B;

thats it.  if you made it this far, congratulations! for even considering trading on this perspective, you are now a more degenerate member of society.  even if we strike it big, we're gonna lose it soon or spend it on food accented with gold flakes, caviar, and our own tears.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%. (Stats as of 2022-10-28)",0.83,18,0,18,dd,2022-11-01T02:09:57Z,yitajz,t3

I have lost a lot like a lot of hard earned money in the past couple months. Last week, all I had left was $600, and I was looking on Friday Oct 28th at a Spy call (everyone was saying puts puts) but I just saw it and i was like this call this is it. But cause of all my past losses, I didn’t have the guts to press submit I just didn’t. And guess what, 2000% gains it went up 2000 frickin percent. I can’t believe I had it all was left just submit and at the end of day I could’ve gained 2000%. But I didn’t make it and I got even more scared cause I missed it cause I was scared. 

Anyway, today I was like I am not missing anything cause of fear, and I made two trades, both expired worthless so $600 is gone. 

I am sick of this. And it’s not like I just gamble. I calculate it and go for it, but I feel like the universe against me. Sometimes when I sell to break even it goes up later. And when I am like leave it let’s not just break even it will go up, no it goes down and down.

What a frightfully boring day today was… This honestly was one of the worst choppy range days I have seen in months. The total range for today on SPY was $3.14… usually we see that level of movement on the opening candle of SPY. 

The question remains where are we headed? 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you to u/80hz14 for posting this in the chat today… as you can see we have a few possible scenarios and outcomes for Wednesdays FOMC meeting. Overall I would say I am in the 75bps hike and a dovish presser where jpow hints at a 50bps in December. I think we should see a 3%+ green day on Wednesday. I would be pretty shocked with rising inflation to see JPOW drop a 50bps but honestly it could happen for other reasons.

Today we saw an extreme small range day (only 39% of the 10 day average) inside day that closed as a gravestone doji. With 388.6 remaining as resistance I will be looking for downside until SPY can break free and close over that resistance level. Today we did see that the 386/ 3880 level on futures was impressively strong support. Any time SPY came anywhere near that we would see a pretty impressive pop. 

Overnight and tomorrow those will be our clear “breakout/ down” levels. From there it depends on which way markets want take us. We very well could end up with an equally as annoying range day tomorrow. However, I wouldn’t be surprised to see a small pullback tomorrow down to the 380 range. The last few FOMCs the two days leading up to it have provided a small pullback. 

Key support- 385 -&gt; 380.1 -&gt; 378

Key resistance- 388.6 -&gt; 390.2 -&gt; 393

Futures also had an extremely choppy overnight and intraday today. However, its daily char is closing with a double top right at 3910 and just under the daily 100ema resistance of 3925. With holding that key support of 3770 all day today we will look to those two key levels tomorrow to guide us on what direction we are going to be headed tomorrow. 

Its not impossible to believe that markets could rally tomorrow with hopeful whispers of FOMC on Wednesday but the historical trend would point to slight downside (risk off) leading into FOMC.

Key support- 3870 -&gt; 3845 -&gt; 3800

Key resistance- 3925 -&gt; 3975

Not much of a surprise after that’s unbelievable Friday that Apple had we had a pretty nice pullback on Apple, although it looks more impressive than it actually was being that Apple only closed down 1.54%. 

Apple is at a key level right here fighting between the daily 200ema of 153.4 and the daily 100ema of 152.2. Historically when it comes to Apple interacting with the 200ema it is a fight that lasts for a few trading days as the daily 200ema on Apple is a major major pivot point. I have not seen too many times where it takes a straight trend line down or up over the daily 200ema. 

Key support- 151 -&gt; 148

Key resistance- 153.4 -&gt; 155.8 -&gt; 157.4

Tesla remains a tricky one to get a good read on, however, as you can see we are maintaining a pretty consistent red sideways consolidation channel from 205 to 230. We have now see our 4th day in a row of Tesla rejecting the daily 20ema and refusing to close over it. However, this is now the 4th day in a row that it has closed over the daily 8ema. As you can see we are in a pretty impressive red bull channel here, however, that blue resistance and red support lines are forming a really nice rising wedge. 

Until Tesla can breakout and most importantly close over the daily 20ema I remain bearish on it. My anticipation would be that we see a move one way or another tomorrow. Key support for that red bull channel is 224.8 tomorrow which is also the 3 day support line and previous resistance line. While its not impossible I would be surprised to see Tesla hold between 230 resistance 224.8 support. 

Key support- 224.8 -&gt; 219.3

Key resistance- 230 -&gt; 234.2

You gotta love the VIX this thing just defies all logic. I am actually surprised with FOMC in two days to see the VIX unwind more like it did today, however, the VIX actually had a really impressive spike at open and closed down with a nice inside day… one of those odd days where the 10year yield, DXY and VIX were all red and SPY was red. 

Some of the issue I saw today was that over all price action, volume and momentum opened pretty bearish this morning, however, the VIX continued to unwind and I believe that led to a lot of this choppy tight range price action. The VIX is currently holding right at the same level it was prior to last FOMC where the day before fomc closed at a VIX of 27.15. 

Overall no real sense of direction for SPY tomorrow as until FOMC happens the market in my opinion is not going to play nicely and not play by the technicals. 

FOMC day is setting up to be a really nice day for some nice wins, I have posted that TA and trade plan/ analysis. Make sure you give it a read! 

10% challenge-

Today was a really tough day for me today. Actual scalp wise I did do fairly well today, however, I had my level to level calls from Friday that I should have closed the Tesla calls green this morning (regrets) and I actually ended up closing them pretty early this morning when pretty much everything pointed to downside… only for them to pop up right after I closed them. If it wasn’t for those two woulda been a decent day despite the hard price action. 

I also thing that’s something that is going to catch this market by surprise here very soon and possibly even tomorrow for pretty much the last week or two now the price action of SPY in the mornings has been pretty bearish and has also been support by volume too. However, by 11ish we have seen a complete snap of trend and 180 reversal… today just chopped instead of broke out. I wonder if we get a slight sell off tomorrow as people get caught thinking its time to buy the morning weakness. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bpvi8i5on7x91.png?width=883&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a2874c15f1667138319a8a6f0de51c94dc5841f

Closing out my most profitable month of the year and also one that I do not plan to attempt to beat. Great month with some great plays. Keeping in mind that my average % gain per trade was still only 12.7% for the month. This wasn’t so much about getting random massive winners… though I had some nice wins in there too… it was more about consistent small gains that have added up over time and most importantly limiting downside risk with a -20% stop loss. 

I posted my article about that this weekend but something to keep in mind is that just because I use a -20% stop loss on my scalps doesn’t mean that is right for you. You have to find what works for your strategy and your overall profits/ trade. The whole theory is though that you can have an extremely successful strategy but if one loser wipes out all of your weeks profits or numerous days of profits then you need to manage your risk better. It’s a balancing act of having a lose enough stop to not stop out too quickly (especially on my level to level plays) BUT not having such a big stop loss that it hits and the loss takes numerous trades to overcome.

Mostly for my own records but I am going to starts separating my scalps and my level to level trades from eachother and this month of November I really wanna analyze the comparison of them and everything more closely.

91,wallstreetbets,predictany007,self.wallstreetbets,18,JPMorgan Says Dovish Fed Could Spark The S&amp;P 500 To Rally 10% In One Day.,"While hopes for a less aggressive Federal Reserve helped US stocks overcome last week’s flurry of disappointing earnings from tech giants, JPMorgan Chase &amp;. Co.’s trading desk now sees room for a massive rally should policy makers turn dovish when they announce their decision on Wednesday.

The S&amp;P 500 could surge at least 10% in one day if the central bank raises interest rates by a slower-than-expected half of a percentage point, and Chair Jerome Powell signals willingness at the press conference to tolerate elevated inflation and a tightening labor market, according to the bank’s sales team including Andrew Tyler. The scenario is the “least likely” to materialize, yet the “most bullish” outcome for equity investors, the team wrote in a note to clients on Monday.

Laying out every possible scenario on Fed day, the JPMorgan team is embarking on a high-stakes task of predicting market moves based on an event that has largely been positive for stocks this year. Of the six prior meetings, the S&amp;P 500 rose four times on Fed day and fell on the other two, according to Bloomberg data.

To be sure, the bank’s economists expect the Fed to boost rates by another three-quarters of a percentage point, in line with the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey, and Tyler’s team views other scenarios as less likely. Still, the exercise offers a lens into the risks that investors are grappling with.

“These outcomes are skewed to the upside as our view is that last week the market had every reason to retest lows given the disappointment from megacap tech earnings and still moved higher,” noted Tyler and his colleagues. “Several client conversations have focused on trying to identify who is the incremental seller; we think the risk/reward is to the upside.”

Below are the scenarios from the JPMorgan team on how the S&amp;P 500 could react on Fed day.

* 50 basis point hike, with a dovish press conference: “It is difficult to conceive of a scenario where this outcome occurs given inflation levels and a tight labor market,” the team wrote. “Should this outcome occur, the immediate reaction could produce a double-digit one-day return for equities.” S&amp;P 500 up 10% to 12%
* 50 basis point hike and a hawkish press conference: An outcome that could stem from a Fed that is increasingly concerned about financial stabilities as it balances growth and inflation. S&amp;P 500 up 4% to 5%
* 75 basis point hike and a dovish press conference: A scenario viewed as having the second-highest probability of playing out. “If you saw the Fed give explicit guidance for the December meeting, then that is likely viewed as a dovish outcome.” S&amp;P 500 up 2.5% to 3%
* 75 basis point hike and a hawkish press conference: “This is the most likely outcome with Powell retaining optionality for December and 2023 meetings while emphasizing the current risks to inflation moving higher.” The team also views this as the outcome most expected by bond markets, so says there may not be a significant move in yields that keeps equities from melting down. S&amp;P 500 down 1% to up 0.5%
* 100 basis point hike and a dovish press conference: While this is seen as unlikely as a 50 basis point hike, it may mean the Fed both wants a higher terminal rate and wants to complete the tightening cycle this year. “Separately, the market may digest this move as the Fed having prior knowledge of where next week’s CPI prints.” S&amp;P 500 down 4% to 5%
* 100 basis point hike and a hawkish press conference: Considered the best outcome for equity bears waiting for this latest rally to dissipate. “Here this would seem to be a Fed reassessing its own inflation forecasts, which some investors feel is too optimistic.” S&amp;P falls 6% to 8%, likely resting year-to-date lows.

Smith, Commissioner United States Securities and Exchange Commission before the American Bankers Association . . . , February 8, 1971 - when the NASDAQ began trading on February 8, 1971, as the world's first electronic stock market ""A Piece of Paper Revisited""","""What I want to discuss with you today is a piece of paper. It is nothing more than that, and yet it represents a great deal more. 

It is a piece of paper that vitally affects you and us and the entire financial community. It is also a piece of paper that despite being old and encrusted with a century or more of hoary legalisms has the most amazing, the most appalling reproductive capacity -- it procreates not merely subdivisions of itself but during the course of its life and travels generates an incredible number of relative pieces of paper, that cling to it, describe it, give it directions, authenticate it, transfer it, transform it, cancel it, encumber it. Like all relatives, these attachments are each very different and together very expensive.

The progenitor piece of paper to which I am referring, of course, is the stock certificate.""

\---

A lengthy read, that I'm too lazy to type it all out. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1971/020871smith.pdf)

Why did I come across this, some might ask? 

Well, I was trying to find out when stock market became electronic. Then I was wondering who programmed it.. 

Okay then, why am I curious about who programmed it?

I'm kindly regarded, hugely. But I still wonder things sometimes; If some of you are like me, and have been glued to these charts past 2'ish years - there's a kind of relative thing happening.. I can't quite describe it but as a uh, prolonged barrel-rolling sewing machine pattern, if that makes sense... and it's not 'making' something it's .. well, sort of seeding a landscape we're looking at from top-down..

Which got me to the wondering part, who was it that programmed the NASDAQ initially? 

6oo6ling that specific Q got me nothing so I broke down what I could possibly render a reasonable direction from: computer/software companies in the 60's

A few things stood out to me - IBM, Fortran, and [Harlan Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills) 

IBM because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then. 

"" In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than [4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1946%E2%80%931959:_Postwar_recovery,_rise_of_business_computing,_space_exploration,_the_Cold_War) were IBM machines. ""

&amp;#x200B;

[Fortran](https://emmachev.com/what-is-the-difference-between-pascal-and-fortran-programming-languages/) because it is a procedural, imperative, general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations. After IBM developed it in the 1950s, it soon gained popularity in programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then Harlan Mills. Just look at his timelines and titles. Specifically -  

* Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1975–81

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my thinking.. SEC knew then what we know now. Banks are assholes doing asshole stuff (if you read more of ""A Piece of Paper Revisted"" (see way above). And they figured, well, if we get rid of the human element (to some degree) this might make things more legit for more ppl than less of them. 

IBM is a huge, American computer company. Invest in America, it was the 50's/60's afterall. We were boomin' baby. And they have this Fortran language that handles all kinds of processes. Then we have Harlan Mills - I mean for all what was going on above... he has a suspiciously obvious time gap.. then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth.. pretty sus cuh.

&amp;#x200B;

All right, you've gotten this far in my rabbit hole. 

Along my tinfoil travels, I came across this other dude [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Early_years) \- he apparently influenced Harlan Mills - As an IBM research fellow, Mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development. These included automata theory, the structured programming theory of Edsger Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, and others, and Markov chain-driven software testing.

But what got me in Dijkstra's 'Legacy' section was the [Banker's alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) \- 

The Banker algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an ""s-state"" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

And this is when I came full circle on the part above I was trying to describe at ""I'm kindly regarded."" 

Anyway, this rabbit-hole kinda tripped me out. Figured a share.

Lets review the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November. 

What other macro trends do you think I missed?

i called this Q4 semi rally way back in early October and the Semis bottomed on October 13th . So i feel like the Semi sector now needs the rest of the tech market to participate in order for a post mid term rally to materialize .   


having said that, i think the market typically rallies 16% on the following 12 months post midterms so its a now or never event just in front of us.

This is the worst. Why bother putting in the effort if no one is going to see it?

Our data shows that post and comment removals for new users are a huge deterrent and the reason why many people stop contributing. 

Over the years we've really tried to make it easier to post (some might say it's too easy...) but when things do get caught, the options are few and terrible. 

You can:

1. Complain about mods, say fuck Reddit, and never come back

2. Send a modmail in and at best get a reply 30 minutes later (by which time your submission is dead)

...and that's it.

#Introducing a third option:

3. Hop into a voice channel and immediately speak with a moderator who can reinstate your post

This is one of many new moderation features we're excited to ship that will make submitting posts easier than ever. 

This is just one step towards encouraging more high quality, high effort, posts back into the sub.

I’m only a year old member of the page, but thought i’d share my thoughts because while this page is fun, it can also be toxic at times and not overly helpful or insightful. That being said, there are plenty of times I have seen positivity and  insight. I’m not a professional at this at all, but thought i’d share my thoughts after my first year of trading options…. But first here was my trade today:

I took a short position (bought puts) on TSLA towards the top of its 207-226 channel this morning. Took 2 contacts at 220ish. 1 additional contract at 223ish. I had my stop loss set, and then went to my actual job. The thesis was that it would get back to 207 support in short to mid term.


 I obviously got very lucky that TSLA severely underperformed today and happened to hit my target. I’ve always hung on to losers too long and winners too short, so i was sure to move my stop to break even when it moved my way, and then continually moved my stop up as the trade worked in my favor. Eventually got stopped out around 206 for $1,710. Felt nice because the risk reward was there, and everything made sense, obviously lucky that TSLA was weak with twitter debacle, but nice to have one go my way.


I’m now long two contracts as you can see above. Thesis is TSLA will return to 220s and stay within this channel in short to mid term. If i get stopped out monday, so be it, but the risk reward for me makes sense.


Things i’ve learned the last year: 


1. I can’t trade 0dte contracts. It’s straight gambling for me and i suck at that. I’m also too busy with my actual job to monitor trades like these which i assume require a high level of attention to detail. 3-4 Weeks minimum preferred for me.


2. The trade has to have a clear out front thesis that doesn’t evolve to fit your bias as the trade plays out.

3. Position sizing is so important for my financial and mental well being. I have to be sure to never risk more than a certain percentage of my portfolio. “Preserve precious capital” as a famous trader says makes sense to me


4. The better my mental and physical health the clearer my mind is with trading.


5. Mistakes happen. Basically blew up my account last fall when beginning options and while i hated myself, it taught me a lot about myself, and my tendencies.

6. I prefer to stick with one stock and listen to a few youtubers i like that analyze it. Simple things like supply and demand level, rsi and macd, and paying attention to fed news and the indices.

I’m not an OG here, but thought i’d share my thoughts and a positive trade i made as i continue to grow and improve. Maybe the mods will remove, idk. TGIF


TLDR: i have learned the hard way about risk management, having a real thesis before trades, and avoiding theta decay/ giving myself time on trades by picking better (in my opinion) expiration dates. Also, if i can’t sleep or feel anxious after the closing bell, i know i am not sizing properly and over risking …

# Risk Analysis - Statistical Analysis

Taking in count the stock's price movement from 2002 to 2022, we have the following data:

|Expected Minimum Return|0.16%|
|:-|:-|
|Variance|0.26%|
|Standard Deviation|5.07%|

Taking in count the stock's price movement from 1st December 2021 to Today, 5th November 2022, we have the following data: 4739

Statistically Speaking, investing in GME has a high probability to give you a return around -5 and 5%, with 43.46% of the data population between -5% and 0 and 45.94% between 0 and 5%.

This gives us a 10.60% chance to get an outlier return from the historical data.

Standard Deviation suggests a 13.11% to ride on a price movement higher than 5% or lower than -5%. In the long run the chance of getting outlier is reduced to 5%.

# Risk Analysis - Market Risk

The FED has raised rates to 4%, we will factor in a 4.50% rate instead.

Risk Free Rate is 4.15%

Market Expected Return of 9.40%

# Final Comment

With its current amount of Cash &amp; Cash Equivalents and without any drastic changes in the company structure and business model, GME is expected to burn is cash within 35 Months. Taking in mind receivables and other liquidity, it still have 39 months remaining in operation.

The company can avoid this by taking more loans or selling parts of the company and other assets.

Company doesn't pass Acid Test, and it is in a dire financial struggle to survive.

Still expecting negative income and cash flow from operations for 2023.

Debt is not critical, this shall allows some room for a possible long term loan.

Current Cash can cover only 94% of current liabilities. The company should be able to cover it with receivables.

ROE, ROA, ROIC and ROC terrible.

ROE is in recover, so GG

ROIC worsen and ROA is stable

This suggest that, yes the management is trying to fix the company, with some positive outcome, but they are struggling a lot right now.

Income quality getting away from danger zone, but still in bad situations.

Gross profit margin worsened. Company cannot manage well costs, this is probably due to inflation and macro.

There are ""***Strategic and Operational Risks Related to Digital Asset Initiatives""*** *that can have huge positive impact as well as dire outcome if it fails. This is a huge risk factor.*

In the mid term, 1-2 years, the company shall gradually trade down from current price to $15 with possible spikes due to external factors. Expect (90% chance) movements between -5% and 5% cause historical price action with a 10% chance to cash in or go tits up.

Fundamentals point toward bankruptcy, but as for now, if the management play their card well there is a possibility to recover.

With current balance sheet, market  health and macro, the company is fucked up.

consider a stock that has experienced several highs and lows over the last year through both bullish and bearish trending patterns. A technical analyst using a Bollinger  channel may see that the price is approaching its support trendline. If the stock has a positive weighted alpha it can be an affirmation that the stock’s price has largely been gaining over the last year, **supporting another bulish push higher.**


**why is a European Germany company rising its revenue guidance when apparently Europe is gone to sh**t ? You will find out why it is my honest opinion that Warren buffets reasoning to buy when everyone fears is can be applied for Bayer**

The 2022, full year growth outlook raise  is significant, particularly in its crop science division;:

1. Now expecting a 10% previously 5% in the seed and crop protection market for 2022, driven high quality prices for seeds and crop commodities and inflation.

2. Pharmaceutical division to expand by 6% previously 5%

**The top 2 challenges  and why they are going in favour of Bayer** 

**1) litgations 2) europe economy**

**European economy and the rise of the germans** 

**The dark winter**
- we all know European is heading into a difficult winter, although energy prices have gone down since i write this, it is no guarantee they will remain so. However, the germans are going to spend there way out of this winter and are poised to avoid a recession in 2023.

*it has already begun*

Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase. 



1) winter recession avoided 

https://m.ca.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/germany-dodges-recession-but-inflation-climbs-to-116-2811016

Why will it benefit the underlying stock? 

Spending - stocks go up in spending times bud. 

2) surprising growth,  will it be enough to outpace inflation ?  For 2023  Germany is likely to be okay, and Bayers product are essentials, during hard times Bayer makes money as well.

https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/short_news/germany-under-fire-for-canibalistic-e200-billion-investment/

3) relief plan makes  the EU  worried, if Germany avoid recession by spending, other European nations will want to follow the idea,  inflation cannot be controlled like this. EU therefore sounds the alarm and potential consequences, it is likely that not too many nations will follow suit in my opinion , Germany can afford to be spending, not many  European nations can, making Germany the exception, in fact if Germany being the biggest economy in Europe  makes it through, much of Europe will also make I through. 

The worried citi suggest the following 

*The proposals could cut 2 percentage points off inflation in the next year, according to Citi, but they are unlikely to prevent an economic contraction. The package “may soften the coming recession but also poses risks, in our view,” Citi analysts said in a note released last Friday.*

Why are we using words like economic contraction  all of a sudden instead of recession?

- **The litigations over roundup** and *glysophate*


 Bayer is still facing litigations due to the acquisition of Monsanto and RoundUp and during the last earnings call, Werner Baumann gave updated numbers. There are about 141,000 claims in total and about 108,000 have been settled.

Remember they have already set the cash aside, have won or litigated the majority of all cases. The rest are likely to head the same path.

Here is glysophate  surging 300% in 2021 https://www.agweb.com/news/crops/crop-production/glyphosate-prices-soar-much-300-and-thats-if-you-can-even-get-it

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king: 

Take a look at some of these charts in the past 59 years  have crop production globally  ever decreased over time ? Never, ever.

For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic.

I read online that a Form 25 has to be filed with US securities regulator SEC within 60 days of the first issue of proxy soliciting materials for voting on matters related to the buyout. This form certifies that the stock will be delisted by the exchange upon completion of the merger.

On September 02, Zendesk published the first round of proxy soliciting materials. The deal was then approved by Zendesk shareholders during a meeting on September 19. The Form 25 was now most likely has already been filed around November 02.

The Form 25 won't be made available to the public or be ""considered valid"" unless Zendesk issues a press release indicating completion of the deal, and that the exchange has received evidence of a certificate of merger from Zendesk. Upon all conditions being satisfied, the exchange removes the listing 10 days after the Form 25 becomes public. In 90 days, the SEC nullifies the registration of the securities. If Zendesk were to go public in the future, it would be assigned a new CUSP ID.

When a stock gets delisted as a result of a company going private, options are cash settled for the difference between the buyout price and the strike price.

Given that deals tend to be completed within a week of the Form 25 being drafted and confidentially submitted to the SEC, are you guys willing to risk $5 to buy 77 dollar call options expiring 11/11/2022 in anticipation of the deal closing next week?

# TLDR

Zendesk is incorporated in Delaware according to SEC filings.

If the status changes to an L (consolidated), the transaction has went through.

[https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/Ecorp/EntitySearch/NameSearch.aspx](https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/Ecorp/EntitySearch/NameSearch.aspx)

Zendesk apparently has a charitable foundation, and  the status for their charitable organization will likely change from Exempt to M (Merged) one day early before Zendesk Inc changes their status from General to L (Consolidated) .

**FILE         NUMBER ENTITY NAME**

5606971  ZENDESK CHARITABLE FOUNDATION

[https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/Ecorp/FieldDesc.aspx#ENTITY%20TYPE](https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/Ecorp/FieldDesc.aspx#ENTITY%20TYPE)

It apparently costs 20 dollars each time I want to refresh the status of the entity or to check their filing history :(

Changing the status of a company from General to Merged takes about 2-3 weeks apparently, or 24 hours if expedited services are requested.

After getting the certificate of merger between Zendesk Charitable and Zendesk Inc, the company needs to pursue a certificate of consolidation to create a new holding company. When all the documents are prepared, they are sent to the company through snail mail.

If you are checking the site for real time updates, clicking on the link of a consolidated company will likely cause you to be redirected to the original search page.

If you click on any one of the corporations and the unofficial certificate of good standing fails to load, the company's status has also been changed to consolidation. A potential merger arbitrage will be available since return mail does take at least 1 day.",0.99,6,0,6,question,2022-11-04T23:55:35Z,ymbn97,t3

Lets take a little more of a zoomed out look on the daily this time. What do we see? We see that we are still well within that green bear channel of 2022 and are holding right around that red dotted 50% retracement line. We have also formed over the last 2 months now a very sizeable black rising wedge that support was actually reconfirmed on today. We also held the red channel support of 370.6 extremely well today and rejected the 378 channel resistance all in one single day (which is impressive). Effectively we are stuck in this train and rising wedge until otherwise proven. 

Bull case for next week- bulls want to see a midterm election week rally and see a rally into CPI. First step is taking out that 378 resistance and establishing that as support. From there its time to take the red resistance line out from FOMC and look to retest the daily 100ema resistance around 388-390. 

Bear case for next week- with a looming CPI ahead and the FOMC pivot on the pivot this week bears will look to continue to reject 378 channel resistance and eventually break through and close under the 370.5 support and break the support of the black rising wedge. Once that is broken bears have opened the downside to re-test the 350 to 360 support area. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2bfkkd5a30y91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e512c7c006be622548dd43c6fd3a4df6d5346c99

On the weekly timeframe you can see we actually did break the rising wedge that is present from last week. However, we did come down and retest the weekly 200ema and confirmed that as support this week. With this candle body closing inside of last weeks bears and bulls both have an opportunity to break out next week and this could be the start of a bull flag if the bulls can defend 375.9 next week. 

Key support- 375.9 -&gt; 363.6 -&gt; 357

Key resistance- 390.2 -&gt; 408.6

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2jv8guqa30y91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b0221f5520ba291ee83d3caff612c9865da3810

Futures has a similar rising wedge formed with the downside resistance from FOMC. Overall a really nice double bottom and bullishly engulfing candle on futes daily that should provide some upside for Monday next week. Bulls need to retake that 3805 resistance next week early and bears will look to take out 3710 support early next week. Both of these remain key pivot points for futures. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/eufo1b8b30y91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5a7796d72bee08c5cf9213acc44204d9a54b92e

Futures (SPY too really) has a overall macro falling wedge with a blue bull channel that has a blue/ red rising wedge inside of it… yay TA! Overall this was a double top on the weekly at 3910, however, this could easily form into a 3775 double bottom come Sunday night at open and easily lead to an upside push next week. With the weekly 200ema being held once again we should look at upside not downside. 

Key support- 3775 -&gt; 3705 -&gt; 3590

Key resistance- 3910 -&gt; 4085

Apple had one of the most interesting intradays I have seen on a non major catalysts day in a long time. Apple went all the day down to the October CPI LOD within one penny and someone still managed to rally back and close over 138.2. I actually REALLY would have liked to take apple calls with this closure back over key 138.2 support but it was EOD and too late plus I already had TESLA calls im swinging and SPY I opened instead. 

Apple will look to attempt to gap fill that 145 gap for the bulls and bears are going to attempt to close under 138.2 and put in a new 52 week low. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i9ifx6bc30y91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0cb54a497a1a26685abc6a65cae03b3bf8c0f2b6

The weekly show just how strong this 138.2 support is for Apple and why I was so ready to pull the trigger on calls but was too slow. You can also see that Apple did close back under its weekly 100ema and put In its biggest red week since March 2020 during the COVID crash. 

Key support – 138.2 -&gt; 133.3 -&gt; 129.1

Key resistance- 141.2 -&gt; 147.1 -&gt; 150.8

&amp;#x200B;

Tesla as I had mentioned continues to range in that 205.6 to 234 red channel. I had played some overnight calls on tesla for a huge 47.8% win at open on a 7dte and thankfully closed at open because wow did it get absolutely smacked down. Tesla put in a $20.72 drop from HOD to LOD which was 156% of its average 10day range. A pretty impressive range for Tesla that’s for sure. The biggest thing we have forming here on Tesla is that huge blue/ black diamond and we bounced hard one again off the 205.6 support range. I will be looking for an upside move next week on Tesla and remain bullish especially as long as we continue to hold 205.6 support. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/iztfevdd30y91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3775a029fe4ebe54c829bb59a9c5508c917f74b1

AS you can see on Tesla weekly chart we are still within that downward bear channel and did reject an attempt to breakout over the weekly 8ema. There is also a breakout triangle forming with key level of 224.2 and 207.8 for next week. 

Key supports- 204.4 -&gt; 192.1

Key resistance- 228.3 -&gt; 245

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/157xkwhe30y91.png?width=610&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad41f6767f0490a95c28e16704e60fc6bbd4cee0

We finally saw some volatility with the VIX today with a pretty large rebound spike when we had that huge 1115am dump. However, the vix remains in the downward channel and realistically until we see that resistance broken and see a major major bearish catalyst (cough CPI cough) I wouldn’t be shorting just yet. You COULD start adding slow longer DTE puts like 30-60 dte but I feel you are still early and are just wasting money. WE are also approaching that key 23.6 VIX support area and funny enough before the September CPI we actually were right at the 23.6 support area too. Perhaps we see a pretty bullish three days next week on the markets much like September leading into CPI and then CPI starts the next leg down headed into December. 

Overall I lean for a bullish Monday at least with a possible choppy Tuesday/ Wednesday as markets prepare for CPI but there is a very good chance we could see a pretty impressive green week next week and end up all the back up near 390 before CPI hits. The higher we are the bigger drop I believe CPI could potentially bring for us. 

Daily log- 

This was another amazing week for me. The week really did suck Monday and Tuesday and then after taking that bigger L on Wednesday I was able to recover today and end up finishing the week off going 11 for 11 today with 4 for 4 on scalps and 7 for 7 on level to level plays. Note- a lot of people are inquiring more about my level to level plays so this is something I will once again try to cover and I will make a post this weekend about it I hope.

Interestingly enough… this is now the 2nd week in a row where my level to level plays have netted a greater profit then my actual scalps. This is something I will continue to monitor as time goes forward and I will continue to adjust as time goes on. This week was also extremely tough to scalp as Monday and Tuesday were very untradeable and then Wednesday with the IV spiking was tougher to trade too for big gains. However, with this being the 2nd week in a row with these results I will continue to monitor and see going forward if this trend holds. But for anyone following me who struggles to get in on the scalps while obviously the win rate is no perfect on the L2L plays and never will be with the built in price target stop loss and take profit target (tho I regrettably always take profits early) the profits should greatly outweigh the losses. Definitely something to keep in mind going forward for me. 

Youtube will be up later!  
 

Hope you guys had a great week. See you next week!",0.86,16,0,16,dd,2022-11-04T23:17:31Z,ymaqa7,t3

2,wallstreetbets,DeepNonFungibleVal,self.wallstreetbets,3,Nasdaq Puts and P911 Calls,"Hey guys!

I’m new to wsb, I discussed my stocks more with friends but they all gave up on trading lol. I made big profits in the last years with Tesla and other tech stuff (about 500%). I was basically a buy and hold investor but started with options some months ago to leverage my portfolio. It did well but I’m less optimistic now. I think the next years will be though and shorting the Nasdaq 100 is still a good move now. But I’ll still hold Tesla and Apple. Maybe some other large caps too - It’s hard to let them go after all those years of profits.

The only thing I’m really optimistic right now is Porsche. It startet only about one month ago and the Porsche family is happily buying back as much stocks as possible. They set a very low price on the stock to buy it back very cheap. I think they secretly want to buy back everything to own it again like in the early 2000s. I’m not sure if they are genius or crazy… Anyway I also calculated a target price of 154€ per share in the short term and expect it much higher if they really want to buy it back. The fundamentals and future are amazing and I bought lots of lots of calls. Maybe some of you have also looked at P911 and wants to discuss it.

7,wallstreetbets,caprazzi,self.wallstreetbets,6,Paramount (PARA) - The Cheapest Stock in the Market,"Just coming on to share the mind-bogglingly low valuation of Paramount (PARA). Consider the following:

1.) Paramount possesses the fastest growing streaming offering in the market, Paramount+.

2.) Paramount owns CBS and has the rights to broadcast most NFL games as well as Premier League Soccer.

3.) Paramount Pictures has had a wildly successful year, including the release of Top Gun Maverick, the 5th highest grossing film of all time. 

Despite this, PARA shares are trading at an embarrassingly low valuation:

1.) Price/earnings multiple of less than 8.

2.) Approximately one third price/sales.

3.) Less than half of book value.

Paramount is definitely a company in transition, but this valuation dislocation is borderline criminal. On top of this beautiful stock sundae, you get more than 6% in dividend yield just to hold the shares while you wait for the price to normalize, and the short interest is just under 15%.

22,wallstreetbets,ThreeD710,self.wallstreetbets,2,Effects of Inflationary Boom/Bust or Deflationary Boom/Bust on the businesses involved in Energy,"This is a abridged post and is a summary of the following four scenarios –

1. **Inflationary Boom** – increase in prices along with an increase in economic growth
2. **Inflationary Bust or Stagflation** – increase in prices along with a decrease in economic growth
3. **Deflationary Boom** – decrease in prices along with an increase in economic growth
4. **Deflationary Bust** – decrease in prices along with a decrease in economic growth

And how they affect –

1. **Demand for energy**
2. **Investments in energy**

These scenarios occur in varying frequency and sequence over short periods (about 5 years) of time, which combine to form a regime. A regime can either be inflationary (increasing prices) or deflationary (decreasing prices) and can last several decades. The last four decades have been deflationary, and the next four, **appear inflationary**.

**Why do the four scenarios matter**\*\*?\*\*

Because the change in prices and economic growth affect the rate of inflation, which in turn affects the interest rate, which affects how much money is in the economy. The amount of money in the economy affects commercial and retail borrowing and spending, leading to an increase/decrease in demand for goods and services. **An increase/decrease in the demand for goods and services leads to an increase/decrease in the demand for energy**.

&amp;#x200B;

**How can inflation and economic growth be tracked**\*\*?\*\* (A few examples)

1. **Headline CPI** – measures the rate of change of inflation on a monthly, quarterly, and annual basis
2. **Rent Inflation** – comprises 32% of the headline CPI
3. **Services Inflation** – comprises 57% of the headline CPI
4. **Import Prices** – rate of change in the prices of goods and services purchased from foreign sellers
5. **Producer Price Index** \- measures price change for commodities sold for personal consumption, capital investment, government, and export
6. **Chicago Fed National Activity Index** \- is designed to gauge overall economic activity and related inflationary pressure
7. **Capacity Utilization** \- used to measure the rate at which potential output levels are being met or used

**Why are we heading to a regime change which will be inflationary**\*\*?\*\*

**Let us begin by quickly summarizing the disinflationary drivers of the last 40 years** –

1. **China** – the country managed to bring over 600 million people into the workforce and out of poverty. This helped improve their lives but also provided cheap labor to the global economy. At the same time, China laid the massive manufacturing and logistics infrastructure which has made it the manufacturing powerhouse that it is today
2. **Collapse of USSR** – led to the migration of cheap labor from Eastern Europe to Mainland Europe
3. **Outsourcing** – exasperated with high inflation from the mid 1960’s to the mid 1980’s, developed economies willingly accepted the idea to outsource or offshore their manufacturing to China
4. **Immigration** – the same reason stated in point 3 led to developed economies opening up to immigration from developing economies which led to wages being driven down
5. **Debt** – Increase in debt (through monetary policy) led to businesses running on the loss-making model as well as increased competition
6. **Technology** – the ultimate disinflationary driver which made the World smaller, expedited exchange and execution of ideas, gaslighted innovation, and increased efficiency exponentially

**Now let us understand which of the above disinflationary drivers can slow down or turn inflationary** –

1. **China** – demography is getting older and wealthier and labor-intensive industries such as apparel and footwear are moving to Vietnam and Bangladesh. Also, it could be possible that new disinflationary drivers such as Vietnam, Bangladesh, and India can fill in the capacity of China.
2. **Outsourcing** – many developed countries have elected or are electing populist governments that promise to bring back the jobs by reshoring their industries. Also, Covid lockdowns and the Russian – Ukraine conflict has shown governments how globalized supply chains are vulnerable and de-risking supply chains to some extent by localizing them would be a strategic necessity.
3. **Immigration** – again, many developed countries have elected or are electing governments that promise or have a mandate in place that caps immigration which would cut off access to foreign cheap labor and talent.
4. **Debt** – many developed countries are running debt to GDP ratios in excess of 100% and any increase in debt through monetary policy would be a very unpopular opinion among the population

**And the new drivers of the Inflationary Regime?**

1. **ESG** – The transition to Net Zero involves a large negative supply shock and mega capex
2. **Inequality** – the disinflationary regime of the last 40 years worked in favor of the capitalists against the labor, and the monetary policies in place since 2008 exacerbated this inequality. The current inflationary period will put pressure on governments to work on closing the gap in inequality, which will further increase pressures on inflation
3. **Fiscal Policy** – governments are already putting money in the hands of the people so that they can weather the inflation or are providing subsidies. Fiscal policy is proven to be inflationary.

&amp;#x200B;

**As this is an abridged version, I have briefly listed the reasons for my base case of an inflationary regime. I believe that we are currently in a stagflation environment and may either remain in a stagflation environment for a while or alternate between an inflationary boom and stagflation.**

**Having said that, I would like to briefly mention a few of my thoughts or rather, my musings. Will post these musings in a Part 2 Post as this post is already long.**

**Will update this post with the link to Part 2 when I post it.**",0.6,2,0,2,dd,2022-11-04T19:58:07Z,ym5osp,t3

This post may seem like a joke, but it's not.

I earn approximately $3500 per year, that's right, not per month but per year lol.

That's why I always wanted to have a lot of money, not to spend on myself, but to give dignity and meet basic needs to my family.

That's when I realized that I should know the rules of the financial market, to play the money game.

I realized that there are a lot of unfair things, such as: The bank would lend me 125x an amount to invest in a stock, but they wouldn't lend me the same amount to finance a house.

So I decided to stop being sad about it, I accepted reality.

* Apple's market value is now higher than that of Alphabet, Amazon and Meta combined.
* The iPhone maker's worth stands at $2.307 trillion, while its tech peers add up to $2.306 trillion.
* Tech stocks have suffered after posting poor quarterly earnings, but Apple dodged a wipeout.

Apple is now worth more than fellow tech giants Alphabet, Amazon and Meta combined, after it ended trading Wednesday with a market value of $2.307 trillion.

At the same time, the market caps of its three tech giant peers added up to $2.306 trillion at the close of trading Wednesday. Google parent Alphabet's market cap stood at $1.126 trillion, Amazon's at $939.78 billion and Facebook parent Meta's at $240.07 billion, Yahoo Finance data showed.

Overall, Big Tech stocks suffered a brutal selloff last week on the back of disappointing quarterly earnings. But Apple's stock has outperformed its peers after it beat Wall Street's revenue and profit forecasts for its fourth quarter.

The iPhone maker's shares soared 8% in the wake of its results. After their earnings reports, Meta plunged more than 20%, Amazon fell about 10%, while Alphabet saw a single-digit decline.

Alphabet, Amazon and Meta's lackluster earnings signaled that demand for digital advertising is flagging. The poorly-received results have helped wipe billions off their market values as their shares fell, and pushed Amazon out of the trillion-dollar market cap club.

Over the past five sessions, Apple's stock has risen 0.16%, while Alphabet has fallen 5.7%, Amazon is down 17.0% and Meta has lost 7.6% over that period.

Despite Apple's achievement, its market cap has fallen back from its $2.193 trillion value at the end of 2021. A series of headwinds — high inflation, rising interest rates, fears of recession and the Ukraine war among them — have meant tech stocks have struggled in 2022 as investors lost appetite for higher risk assets.

52,wallstreetbets,predictany007,self.wallstreetbets,7,Hedge fund Elliott warns of more pain to come after 2022 market rout," 

Florida-headquartered hedge fund Elliott Management believes the global economy is in an “extremely challenging” situation which could lead to hyperinflation.

In a report on Thursday (Nov 3), the Financial Times (FT) cited a letter sent to investors (and seen by the newspaper) that “investors should not assume they have ‘seen everything’” because they have been through the peaks and troughs of the 1987 crash, the dot-com boom and the 2008 global financial crisis and previous bear and bull markets.

The British daily newspaper said the firm, led by billionaire Paul Singer and Jonathan Pollock, added that the “extraordinary” period of cheap money is coming to an end and has “made possible a set of outcomes that would be at or beyond the boundaries of the entire post-WWII period”.

The letter said the world is “on the path to hyperinflation”, which could lead to “global societal collapse and civil or international strife”.

Elliott executives estimated that markets have not fallen enough yet and equity markets could drop more than 50% would be “normal”, adding that they couldn’t predict when that would happen.

They warned clients that the idea that “‘we will not panic because we have seen this before’ does not comport with the current facts”.

They blamed central bank policymakers for the current global economic situation, saying they had been “dishonest” about the reason for high inflation.

They said lawmakers had shirked responsibility by blaming it on supply chain disruption caused by the pandemic instead of loose monetary policy imposed two years ago during the Covid-19 peak.

These divisions will be: Cannabis, Branding and a 3rd to be named later (this division is being created from within). Our plan provides for each of these divisions to be generating revenue by the end of December 2023.

We estimate that we will file the Super 8-K and financial statements within days after receiving the audit for Consolidated Apparel, Inc (""Consolidated""), which is currently producing about $1.2 million in annual revenues and will remove the Company's Shell designation and add revenue to our books. Consolidated has identified several acquisition targets that complement the Consolidated operations, which if assimilated will potentially increase annual revenues. These transactions, if completed will be structured as Asset Purchases to expedite closings.

In July of 2022, the Company issued 598,800 shares of Series B Preferred for 49.9% of GCTR Management, LLC (""GCTR""), a management company in the cannabis sector in California with two clients. GCTR currently grosses revenues of approximately $300,000 per month. We have an option to purchase the remaining 50.1% percent but will look to extend that date until the end of 2023, so we can pursue other opportunities to increase our presence in the cannabis sector in California. We will continually seek new acquisitions to potentially increase our revenues and will look to lock down 49.9% of two other entities with options to acquire the remaining portion by the end of 2023.

We have agreed to work on new projects with our partners in California with each side owning 50%.

Our new division is being set up from within services of a sector our management has decades of experience in, which we are planning to roll out during the 4th quarter of 2022.

Additionally, in the 4th quarter, we plan to begin setting up operations in the Caribbean to expand both our Branding and Cannabis divisions.

A new report delivered to Maryland lawmakers this week shows the national market for legal cannabis growing to $72 billion per year by 2030.

A $75 Billion Industry

The report, which was prepared and presented to the work group by Mathew Swinburne, associate director of Network for Public Health Law-Eastern Region of Baltimore, includes information from New Frontier Data that projects steady growth of the nationwide market as current markets mature and new states are added to the roster of legal cannabis states. Growing from $32 billion in 2022, the projection estimates a total market nationwide of $72 billion by 2030. 

“We know that the cannabis industry is a profitable industry,” said Swinburne. “This is a new industry that is filled with economic opportunity and that opportunity is only growing,” he added. “Although this industry presents some significant economic opportunities, communities of color are missing out on this cannabis boom.”

Swinburne told the work group that jobs in the cannabis industry rose from about 321,000 in 2020 to approximately 428,000 a year later. However, the report also notes that 81% of cannabis businesses are owned by white people and 58% of businesses have no employees who are members of minority groups. 

Main benefactors of this growth remain TRULIEVE, VERANO, GREENTHUMB, CURALEAF, CRESCO Labs 

The five largest MSOS - and most profitable - currently operating in USA.

Hip-hop mogul and entrepreneur is acquiring marijuana assets to be divested in merger of Cresco Labs and Columbia Care

Sean “Diddy” Combs has agreed to purchase licensed marijuana operations in three states for up to $185 million, adding a new business to a portfolio that includes fashion, media and spirits.

If approved by U.S. and state regulators, the deal could create the nation’s largest Black-owned and licensed cannabis company. Mr. Combs said he wants to use the business as a platform to increase Black participation in the cannabis industry.

He said he decided to enter the market to help address long-running inequities. Black people have been disproportionately arrested for marijuana crimes, research has shown. They also comprise a tiny percentage of those making money from the legal cannabis market. In the 26 years since California first legalized medical marijuana, cannabis has grown into a $27 billion legal business in the U.S. and is projected to reach $42 billion in annual U.S. sales by 2026, according to data service BDSA.

The recipients of the proceeds - cresco labs and columbia care who are merging - are one of the top five components of MSOS ETF - which includes TRULIEVE, VERANO, CURALEAF, and GREENTHUMB

CEO Harry Vafias Commented

This quarter’s unprecedented profitability growth is solid proof that our company’s strategy is paying off. With the capital recently raised we have managed to grow our fleet, substantially increase our profitability and cash flow and create value for our investors. As a result of having acquired six vessels in the course of ten months, we generated net income of $15.5 million in a single quarter which is 15,400% higher than our profit in Q2 22’ and equivalent to 23% of our current market capitalization; We incurred moderate debt during the quarter, maintaining a healthy capital structure with $42.3 million of debt while preserving a free cash balance available for further fleet expansion of about $92 million. Given the strong market fundamentals and the promising charter rate environment and by taking advantage of our efficient management of our expanded fleet, we believe that we will achieve strong results and generate significant cash flow going forward. However, the valuation of our shares of common stock does not reflect our strong financial performance and capital available to fund our growth prospects.",0.53,1,0,1,news,2022-11-04T07:48:46Z,ylq6u3,t3

This carried into the present, where I do the same, but have more money to waste.

Over the past 2 years I've gambled away around 15k into options, which doesn't sound like much, but keep in mind I'm a 19yr old college kid. My gambling addiction from options also led me to get into actual gambling, playing online blackjack and roulette (and of course I lose everything I put into it).

I spend money on almost nothing else but options/gambling. I've put around 20k into other business ventures like game development or e-commerce but I've lost all of that as well because of course those ventures led no-where.

So I am here now, completely broke with a crippling gambling addiction, losing my mind every single night more and more. The only escape I have from this life is the gym, going there almost every day to distract myself from the pure failure I am.

61,wallstreetbets,c0diiii,self.wallstreetbets,8,The Hindenburg Omen - A Indicator Present When Market Conditions Are Ripe For A Crash,"\*\*\*For those of you interested in technical analysis, this post is for you. Before you read the long post, there is a link with a video that is more up to date on market conditions and shows the indicators in action. I thought this was a good topic for a discussion due to current market conditions.\*\*\*

**The Hindenburg Omen** \- A rare market signal with a foreboding name is telling traders to prepare for a possible significant decline. Invoking the memory of the flaming explosion of LZ 129 Hindenburg in 1937. The stock market “Hindenburg Omen” signal plays on images of a monumental disaster.

It is easy to see why many of such observations preceded the **35%** drop in the **S&amp;P 500** in early 2020 – certainly a stock market disaster by any measure. However, when these signals are present, it may be good practice to form an exit strategy and help mitigate any potential losses. Let’s dig into what this indicator is and why its signals are important warnings for precarious market circumstances. 

What is the Hindenburg Omen?

The Hindenburg Omen is a term used in stock trading where certain market conditions align to form a signal. For instance, it’s a warning that conditions are ripe for a steep market decline. 

What are the market conditions to incite this tumble? Look for the following four conditions all occurring on the same day:

* The number of new **NYSE** 52-week highs is greater than **2.8%** of all unchanged issues.
* The number of new **NYSE** 52-week lows is greater than **2.8%** of all unchanged issues.
* The number of new 52-week highs is not more than double the number of new 52-week lows.
* The **NYSE** Composite Index 50-day moving average is rising.

**These first two conditions are the important ones.**

Having a significant number of stocks making new 52-week highs at the same time. While a significant number are making new 52-week lows, signals an unhealthy market. When markets are well-behaved, most stocks tend to move together. When they do not, we should be warned and either readjust or improve our trading discipline. 

\*\*\***That warning puts us on notice that for the subsequent 30 days after any observation, there is a greater than normal chance of a crash on any one of those days where the McClellan oscillator is less than zero.\*\*\***

A Hindenburg Omen in 2022

Market observers saw some signals of another Hindenburg Omen as the markets started to decline in January of 2022. Whether this induces another crash remains to be seen. But it highlights why it is important to keep an eye out for indicators suggesting a crash. Especially in unpredictable markets. They are infrequent, but when they occur, it can give us an early warning to watch for signs that might corroborate a decline.

In late 2021 and again in early 2022, we saw a cluster of Hindenburg Omen observations, as recently as January 14th. That has put us on warning to look for exactly the kind of selling which we have already observed and the potential for even more. On any day when the McClellan oscillator is below zero, down moves could turn ugly.  

This warning sign will remain for a 30-day period from the last observation. When significant selling follows the omen and then turns the 50-day moving average of the **NYSE** composite index down, as it has in early 2022. There cannot be another, fresh Hindenburg observation until the moving average turns back up. Bear markets often begin with attempts to regain a new high which fail. Often this action can set up fresh Hindenburg Omen signals for a subsequent leg down. If markets do bounce, it will be something to watch for.

There are some who say that the Hindenburg, filled with hydrogen, was destined for disaster.  However, the airship traveled ten times from Germany to the United States without incident before the crossing where it burst into flames, and **36%** of those aboard perished.

**Likewise, not every observation of the Omen ends in a stock market disaster. It is, however, a sign of a dangerous condition.**

I found a supporting video that discusses this signal in detail with examples of charts and how you can set it up on our trading platform.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%. (Stats as of 2022-10-28)",0.83,8,0,8,dd,2022-11-04T02:32:00Z,yljvwz,t3

I've been using equity Options for a couple years to boost yield. Not Robinhood, not even based on WSB, but legitimate income boosting from my own individual research. It started with simple covered Calls, and then I made a few quick bucks with cash-covered Puts. It was some of the easiest money I ever made.

Jim Cramer says that pigs get slaughtered. Unfortunately, I started getting piggish. Jim does have his moments from time to time.

I got a little looser with my Puts, by not having cash to cover in my brokerage account. I have the cash, but it's in Savings. I started making riskier Puts because they had nice premiums. Had to roll a few, even took a few debits, but was overall positive in taking free cash in exchange for a little risk.

My usual tactic was to watch for a symbol to lose 10-20% in a day, wait a day to stabilize, and then sell a Put for another 20% discount. And I'd get 5% annualized yield. They almost always expire harmlessly OTM. Money for nothing. Easy, right?

Some dipped too close for comfort, or even went ITM. No problem, I can roll. Once or twice, I had to open a new nearly-naked Put position to buy out or roll another one. Like paying off a credit card with another credit card. Financial coaches always recommend that kind of behavior, right?

Well, this week, I had 3 of these riskier semi-naked Put positions hit a trifecta. Bad press, bad earnings call, and the Fed Meeting. All 3 plunged 50-80% in days. Far below the Strike. Of the 3, there is really only 1 that I wouldn't mind owning.

Rolling will cost me almost all my gains from the last year, most of which are already invested into other shares that are covering a Call position. So I'll probably have to infuse more cash to buy back or roll at least 2 just to prevent a forced assignment 50% above the share price. Income accounts are meant to withdraw from, not dump more into just to avoid losing even more cash.

Please learn these lessons:

1. Don't sell a Put on a company that you don't want to own.
2. Have the cash in your brokerage to cover it.
3. Don't transact right before Earnings season when it's already a volatile stock.
4. Low volume Options are harder to roll your way out of.
5. Limit your Puts to 1-2 at any given time.
6. Don't be greedy.

Fortunately for me, these are all low dollar mistakes. I set a personal cap at $25 share price to sell a Put, and that saved my hide. Had this happened with high flyers like Meta, I'd be hosed.

Anybody can make easy money once, but the tenth time will bite you bad. Invest wisely.",0.87,22,0,22,loss,2022-11-04T02:19:42Z,yljm1w,t3

Hear me out. FuboTV is reporting earnings tomorrow morning. There's been an uptick on Google searches for Fubo in the past 3 months alongside increased searches in related topics of sports TV subscriptions:

* [https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=%2Fg%2F11c60pfzx6&amp;geo=US](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=%2Fg%2F11c60pfzx6&amp;geo=US)

Compare this to Roku, which did not experience this search uptick. Roku also spent a lot of capital on physical Roku TVs, which the markets punished after its earnings yesterday. Fubo is unburdened by these types of capital expenditures.

* [https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=%2Fm%2F0\_x7l9\_](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=%2Fm%2F0_x7l9_)

Currently, **short interest in FUBO is 24.95%**. With Fubo trading at all time lows, Fubo just has to not report terrible earnings and awful future projections (subscriptions by sports fans are quite resilient to recessions because it's an ""affordable luxury"") for the stock to rally. This domino can lead to a squeeze.

First of Degens I don't like FB which has 2 billion users still a day I also don't care much for mark Z which is either James Halliday  from Ready player one or IOI, I feel its the latter.

https://preview.redd.it/81o9ob4e9tx91.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ec399ad44901de81c8023e2ea495580e954fe9d

\*I don't care for their policies but I do still keep FB because of family and friends, easiest way to find someone, I also Use IG a lot more lately, and whatsapp.

\* I don't care for Z's meta dream currently but I like the cash generating machine and I like todays 2015 valuation. Here is my thesis for long $META.

META dropped -38% in the last 8 days! Which is a +60% upside to OCT 27th prices. I have a feeling funds will be averaging down soon. See charts below.

https://preview.redd.it/wrzy8aklftx91.png?width=1396&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39bfeff5b048823067907033f7fc049ca2535e23

&amp;#x200B;

[META is projected to grow  to record rev in 2023 to 2025 still and just needs to cut spending. ](https://preview.redd.it/yf06wq8patx91.png?width=2110&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01a967cbf7c19800ac2970d23463433cae9e6796)

First of lets talk about why META is down. Obviously when other tech stocks, some of the biggest in the world can drop -20% overnight like AMZN recently did, NFLX -39% overnight it shows we are in one of the most volatile markets ever. Never have we seen such giant market caps drop this much. So this for 1 presents a big opportunity for me.

:Note NFLX has recovered from that -39% overnight drop and is still up 65% since even with the big drop this past week. It recovered 88% in around 4 months time even with the NASDAQ falling -30% since its drop.

https://preview.redd.it/871e3q18ctx91.png?width=1371&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e12efa6bbc5b3e13656784111d463108b1784ec

&amp;#x200B;

The main reason META is down is because of their spending, but many think Meta is spending only on the METAVERSE which is not the case. Their big spending is for the following which will generate record future cash flow with their current ad rev strategy on new platforms.

**Reasons for future Rev growth even in a recession.**

1)Instagram reels fully monetized

2)Whatsapp &amp; Messenger monetization

3) New AI Discovery Engine to make ad targeting more effective with higher average revenue per user.

4) 2.93+ Billion family users fully monetized.

5)An economic downturn recovery &amp; or more spending for ads again.

**Revenue declined slightly because of the following &amp; can rebound quick**

IMO it is Cyclical as number of users are increasing and user time is rising.

1. U.S. Dollar was beating other currencies and Meta gets a lot of ad rev in international markets.
2. A lot of ads from finance have slowed, the highest paying ads, once we sees a rise in market sentiment those ads come back.

3)Instagram and facebook  reels are not being monetized YET which gets 140 BILLION reels played DAILY!, neither is Messenger and Whatsapp.

4)Apples 2021 Privacy changes, Note The New AI discovery engine will fix this for Meta.

5) Mark and management have started record spending currently on infrastructure /AI discovery engine which is what they are spending the most.

6) 2022 expenses $85-87 2023 projected $96 to $101 billion, which Meta can still be cash flow positive but Mark should and could revamp some spending and do this over 2 years vs 1 and the stock could see a massive move up as funds come back.

7) Many funds have far higher averages and IMO could start averaging up.

These funds below have added before the big drop! Algos have likely been selling as well.

https://preview.redd.it/bt0m3axigtx91.png?width=2132&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a82cce52a2e077bf7e6c704278a2e4b463ebda4d

[META is still top 100 revenue generating companies in the entire world ranked at 65 for rev, and 19 out of 7126 for Earnings STILL.](https://preview.redd.it/qbtgcdfdhtx91.png?width=1293&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=863a7752f43c17aea1b9b7d5a40ba6122dc50e3e)

https://preview.redd.it/m8eyumlcjtx91.png?width=1374&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=580994eecdec4c399d2b3772e1f777f973544164

If the meteverse works out this company is projected to 10x to 25x from todays valuations. 236 Billion and could bring in more revenue than the major stocks with massive overheads AMZN WMT etc with META having little overhead.

 Meta has a family of 3 billion users and growing. Starlink from Elon is  helping third world countries get internet and those are new people to  social media. I have a friend a brazilian actress that visited an amazon  tribe and they are using FB and Instagram and especially whatsapp now  on smart phones. Seriously! Billions of more users open up to social  media as Starlink progresses. People only think in their own bubble and  forget there are billions of people that love metas products. 

TLDR: If meta comes out with a revised spending plan the stock could gap up overnight, They could stretch spending over 2 years vs 1. Even if Metaverse does not work out it can easily 3x from here as spending is for AI ad growth with new infrastructure. Funds Should start to average down soon.

Hope you enjoyed this DD. I like buying Undervalued stocks I got in GME at $4.50 and posted here about it. Not saying Meta is going to go up but I am using profits this year to YOLO it.

# Hedge fund Elliott warns of more pain to come after 2022 market rout

Prominent asset manager says ‘hyperinflation’ could spark one of the worst crises since the second world war

The world is on the road to “hyperinflation” and could be heading towards its worst financial crisis since the second world war, according to Elliott Management, one of the world’s biggest and most influential hedge funds.

The Florida-based firm, which was founded by billionaire Paul Singer and manages about $56bn in assets, has warned its clients of an “extremely challenging” situation for the global economy and for financial markets where investors will find it difficult to make money.

An “extraordinary” set of financial extremes that come as the era of cheap money draws to a close “have made possible a set of outcomes that would be at or beyond the boundaries of the entire post-WWII period,” it wrote in the letter, which was seen by the Financial Times.

“Investors should not assume they have ‘seen everything’” just because they have experienced financial crises such as the 1970s bear market and oil price shock, the 1987 market crash, the dotcom bust or the 2008 financial crisis, it added.

Elliott declined to comment.

The group’s warning comes during a dismal year for markets, in which global equities have shed $28tn in value, according to Bloomberg data, and bonds have also tumbled, leaving investors with few places to seek shelter.

The fund manager laid much of the blame for the looming crisis on central bank policymakers, which it said had been “dishonest” about the causes of high inflation by blaming it on supply chain bottlenecks in the wake of the pandemic, rather than on ultra-loose monetary policy put in place at the height of the coronavirus crisis in 2020.

The world is “on the path to hyperinflation”, it said, which could lead to “global societal collapse and civil or international strife”. While such an outcome is not certain, this is currently the direction that the world was headed, it added.

Its warnings come as investors try to assess the economic damage likely to be felt from a rapid series of large interest rate increases in the US and elsewhere, as central bankers race to try to curb soaring inflation.

The S&amp;P has dropped 20 per cent since its peak at the start of this year, while the Nasdaq is down by one-third since its high a year ago.

However, Elliott said markets had not fallen far enough, given the many risks present, and warned of a further reversal of the so-called ‘everything rally’ seen near the top of the bull market of recent years, as sky-high investor exuberance lifted all manner of risky assets.

There are so many “frightening and seriously negative possibilities” that it is hard not to think that “a seriously adverse unwind of the everything bubble” is coming, it said.

The hedge fund estimates a 50 per cent fall from peak to trough would be “normal”, suggesting further large falls to come in major equity markets, although it added it was impossible to know whether or when that would happen.

Elliott, which is up 6.4 per cent in 2022 and which has only lost money in two calendar years since launch in 1977, pointed to a handful of areas of potential stress that could accelerate market falls. It highlighted banks’ losses on bridge financing, potential markdowns of collateralised loan obligations and leveraged private equity as areas of potential risk for markets.

The firm was also critical of investors who believed market falls will always prove shortlived and can be “ignored”.

The idea that “‘we will not panic because we have seen this before’ does not comport with the current facts”, it said.",0.76,55,0,55,chart,2022-11-04T00:53:12Z,ylhggj,t3

10,wallstreetbets,Kelanfarx,self.wallstreetbets,212,ASTS - An Investment and A Trade (I),"# 1/ ASTS - An Investment and A Trade

If you are a non-virgin, you understand that the sole purpose for investing and trading is to generate returns, to increase the NAV of your brokerage account and to push your net worth in the upward direction. Why? Because it feels good to have the monetary freedom to do whatever the fuck you want, because green GAIN porn is better than red loss porn, and because it is better to look at your account balance and smile instead of twitch in misery. You are here to make money. You are not here to “be right,” — you are here to generate returns, and preferably, returns in excess of the market, in so much excess of the SPY that you are catapulted towards massive capital appreciation (meaningful tendies) before age 80.

The challenge obviously is that it’s extremely fucking difficult to extract money from the markets, especially with an appropriate level of risk. Unless you are a boomer investing with a 50 year horizon, the markets are designed to fuck you over. Markets are difficult and good opportunities are scarce, especially in a bear market environment like we’ve seen YTD. But remember Warren Buffet said “be something when others are something”? Yes, and today is your opportunity.

Right now, an asymmetrical risk-reward investment window is present in ASTS, a company called AST SpaceMobile, where (i) the disruptive technology and scalable commercialization plan are set to create immense value in the coming months, years and decades, (ii) the macro environment allows for a chance to get in *early* into a potential “millionaire maker” name like NVDA or TSLA, and (iii) a contrarian and concentrated bet can provide incredible upside with manageable level of risk.

I am going to spare you impatient people who are already desperately looking for a TLDR from the “generational opportunity” technical thesis but instead show you the swing TRADE SETUP in ASTS that in my mind has a chance of printing money in the next few weeks and months. Three factors: (1) three meaningful catalysts in mid November, (2) continued business plan execution updates, (3) forces from market participants, potentially with better macro tailwinds, could make the ASTS stock spike, consolidate and push upward in a staircase pattern to high levels. Read on.

# 2/ The Background and the Backers

Notwithstanding the fact that Cathie Wood is washed up, disruptive technology wins in the long-term. Not Roku or Zoom but TRUE innovation that propels humankind forward. ASTS pushes forward that kind of technology, aiming to become the first comprehensive space-based cellular service provider, bridging the connectivity gap across the globe by providing high speed internet access to billions of unconnected people, and powering billions of others who move in and out of coverage even in developed markets like the US.

ASTS is launching a network of satellites to provide these services to any mobile device on the planet. That is achieved through deploying and operating satellite “cell towers” in orbit that will cover the entire Earth with 4G / 5G / LTE signal. The technology links directly to any unmodified smartphone, and unlike Starlink, doesn’t require any additional hardware. This monumental step forward in global connectivity is done through launching proprietary 168 BlueBird satellites into orbit and beaming signal through ASTS patented technology.

All sounds dreamy but this achievement means little for ASTS stock without a solid plan for commercialization. ASTS monetizes the technology through B2B revenue sharing agreements with existing global MNOs like AT&amp;T or Vodafone, who already back the company and even have repeated investments in ASTS. These profit sharing mechanisms effectively remove any customer acquisition or CRM costs for ASTS, and open the opportunity for fat free cash flow margins (Transhumanica thinks 90%+ EBITDA margins) after the network is operational.

Right now, ASTS is on path for business plan execution with one of the main hurdles, having the first BlueWalker 3 satellite in space, already complete in September. The BlueWalker 3 is now orbiting Earth at 17,000 mph and is ready to start “unfurling” on November 10th with testing shortly thereafter.

The TEAM: Abel Avellan, Rakuten, Invesat, Vodafone, AMERICAN TOWER corporation.

The guy in charge, the CEO is Abel Avellan. A chad who was founder of another satellite-based communications company EMC that he sold for $550M in July 2016, using proceeds for initial funding of ASTS. He is executing on the business plan with skin in the game with 78M shares (\~$500M currently) and majority of his networth tied in ASTS shares.

Other direct backers that have stakes include **Rakuten, Invesat, Vodafone and American Tower Corporation**. On top of that ASTS has partnerships and conversations with multiple MNOs in different jurisdictions to provide their service through the B2B revenue sharing model once satellites are operational. Quick cap table. Total shares outstanding 183.0M from 10Q as of August 5, 2022.

The BELIEVERS:

* Rakuten, American Tower, Vodafone (along w Samsung) did ASTS Series B then PIPE ($230M) investments.
* Mikitani Hiroshi is billionaire Rakuten CEO backing ASTS with a massive stake.
* Transhumanica with a detailed research paper that I highly recommend. They have an interactive valuation model with a $114 current PT.
* BRiley equity research has outstanding $15 PT.
* DB equity research has outstanding $30 PT.
* Barclays equity research has outstanding $15 PT.
* Also people on the ASTS subreddit have provided incredibly detailed research on the technology and the company.

The NON-BELIEVERS:

* Kerrisdale Capital released some bearish seller research if you’re interested in reading a negative scenario case.

# 3/ The Astrology and the Price

As a former SPAC, ASTS first got attention in late 2020 and participated in the high-growth mania of that period, reaching a peak price of over $25 in February 2021. To me, that price action is of little significance as it was fueled by an incredible frenzy in overall markets, which soon deflated and normalized later in the year. The company de-SPACed in April 2021. Since then, ASTS displayed remarkable resilience despite being a high-growth, unprofitable company in a very punishing macro environment, where rising interest rates have caused the valuation DCF discount rates to go up, valuation multiples to go down, acutely hurting stocks that have more expected FCF value in the future.

The market is a mystery and it can price something far from true value for a long time. It’s hard to value ASTS as most cash flow is in the future. To me, if execution is good, I’d just do $5B EBITDA in 2026 and 8x multiple, discounted to today at 20% – we’d see $100+ per share valuation. Of course it’s a bit binary so we have to be aware of the downside risks with execution at zero. Nevertheless the equity research people are bullish including Deutsche Bank, Barclays, BRiley. You can also take a look at numbers at Transhumanica or peruse through spacanpanman’s Twitter with more research and projections summarized neatly.

Deutsche Bank note from August when ASTS spiked on BlueWalker news:

[Deutsche Bank comment](https://preview.redd.it/ntirufb0osx91.png?width=992&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2800afe12df4affb7e6f9bd89f88f695ab84b4e5)

Interestingly, from June 1, 2022 to present the daily return correlation between ASTS and SPY/QQQ has been remarkably low at around 0.38, which I view as a good thing. Less dependent on daily volatility BS from indexes.

ASTS has traded in a huge channel from the lows of $5.50 to the highs of $14.00 since March 2021 to present. Previous multi-year stock “winners” they all came out of incredibly long consolidation bases which we observe here.

[ TradingView chart of ASTS, 1W ](https://preview.redd.it/dliwwerfqsx91.png?width=1813&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f0034d94a9bd64156001576681377529e74819c)

ASTS year-to-date performance as of October 26 is around -22.8%, compared to the QQQ -34.3%. For a high growth stock, it shows incredible strength — compare it with names like ARKK that are down -62.0% YTD, big dog ABNB -45.2% and SNOW -53.8%. This relative strength gives an indication that despite being currently unprofitable ASTS is likely going to be a leader going forward. Strong stocks are often future winners.

Pretty much from early July to mid-August the indexes grinded higher with QQQ up around 20% — during that time ASTS consolidated in a narrow range. After a few catalysts and good reports in early August, ASTS jumped from around $6.5 to around $14 in a matter of a few weeks. At $14 supply zone, the price action slowed and got slammed down with the overall market and sellers, pushing it down with more inflation worries and higher interest rates woes.

Now we are back at the “support” or demand area, at so-called lows where risk-to-reward becomes super attractive.

# 4/ The Dangers of a Bearish Trade and Previous Catalysts

The no-brainer trade this year was to short unprofitable technology and do nothing but watch how the overall market punishes those stocks. That was the “easy” trade on a company like ASTS that sellers capitalized on. The downward adjustment of multiples due to higher interest rates pushed DCF valuation models lower and ASTS price has been sinking. Naturally, sellers use the opportunity to profit from a structural decline where not much can be done really, the tide goes down and takes every ship down with it. BUT, this can be dangerous when a company is executing on the business plan and has positive developments.

This year we had 2 catalysts that showed what can happen when ASTS keeps executing on the business plan.

1. On March 9, 2022 the news came out that ASTS partnered with SpaceX to deliver their satellites to space. That proved ASTS is meaningfully moving forward with its objectives, and resulted in a ferocious seller covering rally that day, where just “riding with tide” as a seller backfired massively. ASTS stock almost doubled in a day: from lows of $6.20 to highs of $11.40. Later, macro pressures set in again, pushing ASTS lower and the “easy” bear trade came back in, sinking all high risk assets.
2. On July 28, 2022 yet another positive news momentum came in with BW3 satellite launch, that forced a lot of sellers to get out of the way. The frenzied rally more than doubled the stock price in a few weeks. Price went from $6.20 to $14.20, then received expected push back and yielded with broad market weakness.

After Kerrisdale released their bearish report in mid-September price nose dived and we visited the $6 “support area” and bottom of the channel. Interesting to note that previous 2 times, the stock launched from around $6.20.

I think right now there is little idiosyncratic movement to the stock, mostly macro pushing it lower, but that is about to change. Now is an optimal time to get in because we are the bottom of the channel and 3 massive catalysts are upcoming next week, hopefully aided by the tailwinds from macro (not guaranteed) and pressures from sellers relenting as company executes.

# 5/ The New LONG Trade and Upcoming Catalysts

We have an ER update call on Monday, November 14. The three main events will serve as proof of company execution and are likely to push the price up in the next few weeks.

1. Unfurling of the BW3 satellite is going to happen on November 10. Successful completion is likely to serve as a big catalyst to the stock. Satellite will open up and become operational and ready for testing.

[Furled](https://preview.redd.it/5y3wecosqsx91.png?width=643&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd2ae1d0649d74a9db5fe749c1856a6d70bd0d6e)

[Unfurled](https://preview.redd.it/ew43yfytqsx91.png?width=651&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=916c4d08e26af04ecfd10f47c8a29ee23fe2dce1)

2. Testing of the satellite should happen shortly thereafter and an announcement confirmation of working technology is going to be an even larger event for ASTS. This will be the proof that technology works with MNOs.

3. Other funding or partnership updates, like 5G Fund providing indication of possible financing to ASTS may happen by the end of the year, as well as getting licenses in new jurisdictions (Japan), or more partnerships with MNOs.

[Comments on ASTS eligibility for being financed by FCC's 5G Fund](https://preview.redd.it/g1iknnuvqsx91.png?width=1093&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83b7a48437c40c0dc87d4b6a3f9a2ab964afeb4f)

One of the arguments of sellers is that company will need additional funding before generating meaningful free cash flow. Currently they do have runway to revenue, and that gets even better if the FCC 5G fund awards capital to ASTS or if price stays at $18+ for a month, where warrants become redeemable for $200M of capital. Moreover, there’s other non-dilutive financing options, but regardless I think they’ll be explored in second half of 2023 or later.

&amp;#x200B;

[From spacanpanman](https://preview.redd.it/co5m5bc0rsx91.png?width=1194&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a1991c6fc6b4ae4c8fef5e73a7840c35434eeac)

The reason why I think the moves up on positive news could be violent is because there will be additional buying pressure from bearish traders to get cover their positions in face of good data.

Once ASTS confirms that these events are successful, stock will likely become favored by passive and risk-averse investors, with institutional funds buying in and momentum/breakout traders scaling into positions. I believe we’ll get to $14 area if updates are positive, and a breakout above that is likely to clean the path to $18+ which I think is going to be the turning point for the company, that will set it up for long term success.

[ASTS 1D timeframe, imaginary price action.](https://preview.redd.it/wrcwev02ssx91.png?width=1814&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c19d086660cb232eff0c4b823b17f25bc91d5f2d)

Disclaimer, Risks:

Past performance is not indicative of future results. This is not financial advice. There are risks of company failing and stock going to zero.

TLDR:

The no brainer trade this year was to short unprofitable technology and just sit tight. But it is dangerous now, especially on a company like ASTS, which is a powder keg that can explode on successful business developments that are to be announced on November 10 and shortly after. Three upcoming catalysts are likely to serve as a repeat of price action in March and August. Although price is artificially suppressed by the macro environment, once that pressure subsides, the stock will stay high and keep pushing forward as company executes.

12,wallstreetbets,DaddyDersch,self.wallstreetbets,16,"11-3-22 SPY/ ES Futures, Apple and Tesla Daily Market Analysis","Well the day after the FOMC meeting proved to be pivotally boring. After a pretty exciting pre market with how red we opened (bless up for my over night puts) we after the first 45 minutes of the day held the same about $3 range all day long. With a love volume red day it seems there is a lot of sidelines money right now and we could end up seeing buyers step back in. I am cautiously optimistic for tomorrow bull wise though. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/un24xy0nrsx91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f21e31cb538ba7322c65e8041bc1f095f301074b

The biggest thing that I mentioned bear wise that happened yesterday was that we broke through key 378 support (green channel). I had mentioned that 370.5 was another big area. I highlighted it here to make it a little more clear. You can see that there is a clear resistance/ support line right there. With SPY breaking through and then holding over it all day and closing over it today I am actually looking for an upside resistance test. 

SPY has put in 4 red days in a row now so it could be expected we get a green day. The other oddity to say the least is that SPY closed down -1.02% and the VIX also closed down -2.28%. Usually I would say that doesn’t happen but in 2022 and lately its happening more and more. Despite everything the JPOW said yesterday the fear isn’t rising in the markets. This is either  sign by the VIX that we should continue to be bullish and expect upside or this is a really “cheap” opportunity to buy some longer DTE puts. 

Bulls will want to defend 370.5 tomorrow again and more or less leave it in the dust and completely gap fill 374.76 tomorrow. From there they need to retest the 378 resistance line and attempt to break back into that zone. 

Bears will want to finally take out 370.5 and close below it with hopes of testing 365 to 359.9 tomorrow and into next week. This is the first time we have had a full candle close below the daily 8ema since before CPI. 

Key support- 370.5 -&gt; 365 -&gt; 359.9

Key resistance- 374.6 -&gt; 378

Looking at futures we nicely held resistance at 3770 and were not quite able to break through support at 3705. Bulls will look to retake 3770 and possibly key 3805 tomorrow. 

Bears will look to continue the sell off and seek out 3705 and most importantly 3675 support.

Apple looked incredibly heavy compared to the rest of the market and actually was the worst top 10 ticker of the day just barely beating out Google. Interestingly enough Apple is only $3 away from its after hours low of 136 on earnings day. 

Now that Apple is back at the 138.2 support area this is where we can look for it to bounce if it is going to bounce. However, something to keep in mind is that unlike tesla and other stocks Apple has NOT put in its 2nd 52week low… this very well could be its attempt at doing so. 

We have a nice black downward channel inside of a falling wedge that also have a falling wedge inside of the black channel… lol yes I know right?

Tesla continues to be all over the place. We did see it break through that “mid” point of 215 today however it was able to find support nicely at 210. However, it did break through the 2 day drop resistance line it was not able to break through and take out the daily 8ema this morning and had a pretty strong rejection there. I will be looking to see if Tesla finds support here with this doji on a downrend which can lead to an upside recovery or if it will indeed retest 205.6 support tomorrow.

The VIX just absolutely continues to unwind here and doesn’t seem to be phased by anything at all anymore. What will cause the VIX to spike and revery back to the 28-30+ range? Honestly im not sure at this point. The really only big bear event ahead is CPI next Thursday but besides that we have nothing till December. December actually is doing to be a Doozy with CPI on a Tuesday immediately followed the next day by FOMC. 

This CPI still does not have a consensus out… which gives me the same type of vibes from last September CPI which could result in a bigger sell off again. I wouldnt be surprised to see a short rally tomorrow till next week. Markets are looking for that “oh wow yeah lets sell” reason again and I don’t forsee one till CPI. CPI most likely will miss and that’s where it gets complicated. On one hand we know jpow said he isn’t ready to slow or pause… he said inflation aint fixed… so another bad CPI maybe he rockets a 100bps at us? Definitely another 75bps at us… how will markets react? Will we react like September or will we react like October.

We also get to add in the unemployment rate to the mix tomorrow if you remember last month when this hit we had an incredibly red open when this news hits the market.

I am still playing to start the 2.5k challenge… I am refining my strategy on the rules and deciding if I wanna do 2.5k per trade or do a 5k account one trade a day for 10%/ 20% stop loss challenge. I am undecided and will think about it this weekend more.

IF true, and a big if.

Putin's course of action is to play the war out as long as possible win or lose irrelevant, as along as it provide an excuse to bomb pipelines (DONE), and participate in predatory market practices (DONE), and break economic agreements (DONE). Russia doesn't need boots on American soil when he can simply have the central banks do the job for him.

This is a well played out market manipulation on the futures markets and he's causing ripples across the globe and to Russia's benefit.

The ad plan, dubbed ""Basic with Ads,"" will cost $6.99 a month in the U.S. — just below Disney's ad-based price point of $7.99 (which will roll out on December 8.)

""Basic with Ads"" will complement Netflix's existing ad-free tiers and be available in 12 countries, including the U.S., the U.K., Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, and Spain.

The ad tier will feature an average of 4-to-5 minutes of ads per hour. At launch, ads will run 15 or 30 seconds in length, with some running prior to the start of a program while others will be mid-roll ads.

Wall Street analysts are largely bullish on the profitability aspects of the new ad tier, and advertising experts refer to the debut as a make-or-break moment for the media industry.

""It is absolutely a pivotal moment for the industry,"" Kevin Krim, CEO of advertising measurement platform EDO, told Yahoo Finance, citing Amazon's (AMZN) Thursday Night Football as another watershed moment when streaming, subscription, and ad-supported went to the masses.

Looking back, the executive explained, this ""will be the moment where the vast majority of Americans became crystal clear that there's going to be a new way to get the must-watch TV that they care about — and it's going to be through a subscription-based and an ad-supported business model.""

Amid concerns that Netflix subscribers will trade down to the ad-supported version, Citi Managing Director Jason Bazinet previously told Yahoo Finance Live that he views the introduction of advertising as a lucrative revenue driver.

""It's not a spin down risk — it's a spin up opportunity,"" the analyst maintained, estimating that the company could secure $10 or more in advertising revenue per ad-tier subscriber in the U.S.

Based on me being 15% down on my position (7000 shares @ $4.02) and the 2 hours (maybe 1.5) of ""research"" I've done, I have concluded that this stock is underpriced.

The stock is reeling from the news that CVS has likely pulled a purchase offer, but it seems like everyone has forgotten that Humana $HUM is still looking to buy, always had right of first refusal, and is primed to purchase (still up 30% on the year). Both CVS and Humana are desperate to get more of that Medicare Advantage plan money and are basically fighting to buy the company. CVS reportedly stated in their conference call that they are still looking to get into primary care through acquisitions, and failed on their attempt to purchase One Medical who was instead bought by Amazon. Meaning the ""news"" of their pullout is likely bullshit to get $CANO back on sale for the institutions before the actual buyout. Not to mention the market cap of CANO is $1 billion less than the enterprise value (whatever that means, it seems good). Analyst's lowest forecast is $4.04, still giving this an %18 upside worst case scenario and a buyout could reasonably drive this to $12 if not higher. 

In summation, $CANO is an opportunity for free money.",0.54,2,0,2,dd,2022-11-03T18:41:17Z,yl7kw5,t3

Let me explain my theory on profit vs debt","It’s counter intuitive but many companies don’t want to make profit these days. There are many problems with being profitable. First you have to pay tax on profits. Second making profit is actually difficult. Third if you start to make profit it will never be enough for the market and you can’t sell a story of hyper growth company to pump your stocks.

What companies really wanted is asset appreciation whether it be their stocks or real estate. In world of money printing, cheap debt and fiat system, most asset values always go up in price over time. 

Appreciating assets allows businesses to cash out refinance at lower rates. Unlike profit, this borrowed money is tax free as per IRS. The tax free borrowed money is then used to boost revenues through ads, pump stocks thru buybacks &amp; sustain lifestyle of executives and their sugar babies. 

The ponzi continues because some of the borrowed money is used to pump the asset prices. Declining rates help as well. As the debt servicing costs decline it boosts the asset prices allowing businesses to get new round of cash out refinance, pay down smaller debt with bigger debt and continue the ponzi.

Powell grew up in different world where companies actually relied on profits for their liquidity. Not anymore. Business models rely heavily on cheap debt these days. In fact they prefer tax free cheap debt over taxable profits which requires running an efficient business and not just financial engineering.

Powell doesn’t understand simple fact it was the declining rates of last 40 years and access to tax free cheap debt that provided liquidity to businesses and also allowed them to keep prices low for their consumers and inflation in check.

AT&amp;T is the most indebted company on the market, with this being said the increased rates have put increased pressure on AT&amp;T to reduce their debt to lower the debt service the must pay. I believe that this increased interest rate risk has already been priced in.  My theory is that there is significant value that has yet to be priced into the options chain because there is a significant underestimation as to how much the prices will be positively affected when the lowering of rates is announced and when it occurs. So I with this being said I am currently holding 3 calls that expire April 2023.

TWLO: Twilio, shit company, they've been making gay bears cum for the past year and a half. Their ""guidance"" is that their EPS is going to be twice as low as last qtr (-.215 vs. -.4)I think they are going to do the same this evening after earnings. All of the ""analysts"" that post their predictions on Bloomberg and are bullish have a 1yr return of around -77%... That's Cramer in my eyes and I'm going to inverse that shit. However, looking at the options chain, there has been a huge influx of calls over the past day. Will check later to see how the sentiment goes.

PYPL: Paypal, also making the bears horny and proud. Bullish ""analysts"" have also been losing like a degen here, averaging around -65%. I'm planning on inversing these ""professionals"" as well. I see an influx of puts here and have gone ahead and bought puts myself, will adjust near market close.  
Positions: 5x PYPL 4Nov $72p

SQ: I think SQ is the worst among these so call ""pro analysts"". Those who are bullish average around -78% for the past year! I expect to buy puts, but the options chain has no huge skew. Will check later and open position.

SBUX: The only positive one here. SBUX seems to be making money. Analysts are bullish and have decent returns. I am also seeing a nice amount of new OI on calls. Will check later and open position.

There you go, my fellow crayon munchers. Will update y'all on my final positions. My apologies for not posting the most active options lately, but I have been caught up with earning calls!

* Shares of Airbnb fell more than 13% Wednesday, a day after the company released third-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street’s estimates but fell short on fourth-quarter guidance.
* For the fourth quarter, Airbnb said it expects to deliver between $1.80 billion and $1.88 billion, below the midpoint of $1.85 billion as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.

Shares of Airbnb fell more than 13% Wednesday, a day after the company released third-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street’s estimates but fell short on fourth-quarter guidance.

Airbnb beat on top and bottom lines in its third quarter. The company posted revenue of $2.9 billion, up 29% year-over-year for its strongest quarter ever, and topped analysts’ estimates of $2.8 billion, according to Refinitiv. The revenue increase was driven by stable growth in the Nights and Experiences booked and elevated average daily rates.

But Airbnb provided fourth-quarter revenue guidance of $1.80 billion and $1.88 billion, below the midpoint of $1.85 billion as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.

Airbnb said to “expect a continued, albeit choppy, recovery of cross-border travel to be a further tailwind to future results” as countries around the world continue to recover from Covid lockdowns and grapple with high levels of inflation and rising interest rates.

6,wallstreetbets,predictany007,self.wallstreetbets,4,"Guggenheim downgrades Roku, citing warning signs after latest quarterly report","Analyst Michael Morris downgraded the television streaming stock to neutral from buy and removed his price target on the name. He previously had a target of $70 per share on Roku.

“We believe in the long-term opportunity for CTV and see Roku’s active account base and operating assets as valuable,” he said in a note to clients, referencing the app CTV that allows users to watch TV. “However, we struggle to value the business given the lack of detail from the company and the warning indicators.”

On Wednesday, the company issued fourth-quarter revenue guidance that was well below expectations, along with a larger-than-expected adjusted EBITDA forecast. Roku did reported a smaller-than-expected loss for the third quarter, but Morris noted those expectations were already slashed as the business has suffered.

He called the fourth-quarter guidance the “primary surprise,” noting it was “well below” prior forecasts and implied revenue declines due to a drop in up-front spending from advertisers. But he still expects the company to beat when reporting fourth-quarter earnings.

Fourth-quarter total net revenue guidance was predicted by Guggenheim to be 1% lower than the same quarter a year ago. The firm previously expected it to grow 4% in the quarter. Ad revenue is expected to decline 5% in the quarter after being forecast to grow by 7%, while total platform revenue should grow 0.5% compared to the 6% growth expected before the earnings call.

Morris said there is concern over the magnitude of the soft cyclical environments impact on advertising space not bought at the “upfront” event.

Meanwhile, he said the company is still operating at a loss and is likely to increase spending if conditions improve. He also pointed to what he called a lack of visibility into the company’s business drivers such as advertising revenue trends, investment goals and profitability objectives that make it hard to predict future performance.

The stock plummeted 19% in premarket trading following the earnings release Wednesday. Roku has taken a beating this year, losing more than 76.2% through Wednesday’s close.

Uber's total gross bookings were $29.12 billion, slightly below expectations of $29.67 billion. But the company expects total fourth-quarter bookings to rise 23% to 27% from a year earlier. Uber also gave its fourth-quarter profit before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) guidance range of $600 million to $630 million. Wall Street was expecting $567 million.

Meanwhile, UBER also sees positive comments from Evercore ISI’s Tech analyst Mark Mahaney and Wedbush’s analyst Dan Ives. According to Mark Mahaney, Uber is part of the $2 trillion global ride-sharing and delivery market. He thinks the company is on track to grow bookings by about 30% from its current 90 million customers.

""Uber is continuing to see healthy growth as the driver shortage is essentially over while the company continues to benefit from travel returning, shifting to the office, as other post-pandemic trends continue to hold globally with Uber poised to benefit into 2023,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to clients.

Here’s what that tells us about the housing market,"The number of foreclosure starts — which is when the first public foreclosure notice happens — is up 219% since the start of the year, according to real estate data analytics firm ATTOM Data Solutions’ midyear 2022 U.S. foreclosure market report. What’s more, the number of properties that had foreclosure filings (this number includes foreclosure starts) is up 153% from the same time period last year. 

Fully 96% of major metro areas saw an annual increase in foreclosure filings, with foreclosure rates highest in Illinois, New Jersey and Ohio. And when it comes to the number of foreclosure starts, California topped the list, followed by Florida, Tennessee, Illinois and Ohio.

“Foreclosure activity across the United States continued its slow, steady climb back to pre-pandemic levels in the first half of 2022,” says Rick Sharga, executive vice president of market intelligence at ATTOM. “While overall foreclosure activity is still running significantly below historic averages, the dramatic increase in foreclosure starts suggests that we may be back to normal levels by sometime in early 2023,” says Sharga. (See the lowest mortgage rates you can get here.)
What does this uptick in foreclosures mean for the housing market?

Foreclosures are shooting up as the various foreclosure moratoriums that kept people in their homes during the worst of the pandemic’s economic disruptions have now ended, explains Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com. That said, they are shooting up from extremely low levels, she adds — noting that even after the sharp increase in foreclosure activity observed in the first half of 2022, we’re still not back to 2019’s low pre-pandemic mid-year total.

“Much like the sharp turnaround in housing inventory that we’ve observed in the number of for-sale homes recently, when the market has tilted in one direction very extremely, we see huge percentage increases when the trends shift back in a different direction, even though in many aspects what we’re witnessing is just a return to something resembling what was once normal,” says Hale.

Indeed, “it’s important to note that many of the foreclosure starts we’re seeing today — in fact, much of the overall foreclosure activity we’re seeing right now is on loans that were either already in foreclosure or were more than 120 days delinquent prior to the pandemic,” says Sharga. Indeed, many of these loans were protected by the foreclosure moratorium put in place by the government during the pandemic — therefore just halting the inevitable by a couple of years. Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate says, “Foreclosure activity is returning to normal levels after being artificially depressed by pandemic-induced payment relief programs and extended foreclosure moratoriums. In a historical context, foreclosures are still very low.”

And while these foreclosure numbers sound dramatic, Holden Lewis, home and mortgage expert at NerdWallet, says it’s not enough to make a dent in the housing market or the overall economy. “Even a healthy housing market has foreclosures, and this pace is nothing to worry about,” says Lewis.
What does this mean for buyers?

While foreclosures remain unfortunate for the owners of those homes, for shoppers who have been frustrated by the lack of homes for sale in their budget, the increase in foreclosures could bring additional options, says Hale. “But much like the increases we see in for-sale housing inventory, it’s just the first step. We would need to see many more months of these increases before home shoppers will feel like they have an abundance of homes to choose from,” says Hale. source without paywall: https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marketwatch.com%2Fpicks%2Fdramatic-increase-foreclosure-filings-are-up-more-than-150-heres-what-that-tells-us-about-the-housing-market-01659181360",0.93,101,0,101,news,2022-11-03T10:01:19Z,ykvrzo,t3

*  The next step might be 50 basis points.
* More hikes are coming.
* The terminal rate is going to be higher.
* Fed is trying to give investors hope by slowing of rate hike pace but not pivoting at the same time.
* It takes 9-12 months for rate hikes to be felt and 12-18 months for the maximum effect. It makes sense to slow down the current pace given we are only eight months past the first rate hike.
* Fed will want slower total and core inflation, pullbacks in house prices and rents, slower wage growth, lower job openings, and likely an increase in the unemployment rate prior to a real pivot.
* Fed is also concerned about the upcoming winter heating season that may cause another spike in energy prices.
* Rate hikes are likely to continue into 2023 in smaller increments.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%. (Stats as of 2022-10-28)",0.8,12,0,12,dd,2022-11-03T04:30:07Z,ykpuun,t3

Listening through the meeting and listening it through it again, I do sense a bit dovishness in his speech. More so than I had originally anticipated looking at the underlying economic data. Caveat to that is it really involves one thing, the rate of increase, not overall Fed Fund rate increase. On the latter, it looks like he's taking that 25 bps and going to push it towards the Feb meeting. I'm overall still bearish for the time being. 

The rate hike that I initially anticipated would be 75 bps for December. It's looking highly more likely that'll it'll be 50 bps. That said, it's looking way more likely that Feb will be 50 bps increase as well in 2023 and will hold it there. That'll push it towards the 4.75%-5% range.

That said, if economic data doesn't improve halfway through this month going past December, I'm thinking they'll keep pushing rates into Q2 2023 most likely in 25 bps range pushing it over the 5% Fed fund rate point. 

Plan your strategies accordingly and expect a bumpy ride. This latest messaging was less clear with mixed economic data coming. 

TL;DR: Swing trade until mid December data. Expect new bottoms to form some time over the next couple months and then hit capitulation in Q1 2023. Will most likely go sideways for most of 2023 with solid recovery going into Q4.",0.86,5,0,5,question,2022-11-03T00:07:26Z,ykj8cn,t3

Powell agreed there wil at some point be a time to slow rate… however, he confirmed that time is not now and it would be pre-mature… The question that will remain now is was this some unbelievably wild over reaction to what JPOW said or did we just witness the top get put in? There is a case to be made for both that’s for sure.

I took the 389C overnight and that was looking rough for a really long time this morning. Thankfully with the rogue pump before FOMC and then the 2pm pump that was expected I exited for a pretty decent win. Not the best exit but when its moving like that it’s the best you can do for sure. 

That pump also allowed me as expected to exit my now 5dte 386C too for almost 20% win.

I did follow my plan of the 234pm calls. I entered and hit 30% profits pretty much instantly… unfortunately that was where the music stopped playing for me. I fully expected based on movement that we were going to see a really big bullish break out on SPY after the 230 presser as historically has happened. However, it dumped pretty much immediately after I entered. I never saw green again and there was no sense to average down or try to do anything silly. 

If you were okay with small profits it did hit, however, if you weren’t fast it turned into a loss.

Someone asked me last night “why don’t you present a bearish case too?” well until today there wasn’t really a reason to present one. What do I mean by that? Well we had been holding this red bull channel for over 3 weeks now. There was little reason to bet against that until we saw like now a breakdown of that support. 

With SPY now breaking through that green channel support of 378.1 and not only that it also rejected the attempted break through of 388.6 resistance I do favor a bearish case now. With the blue resistance line and red bull channel support line there was also a rising wedge formed that has now broken. 

From here we look at our key levels which will be that 378.1 resistance level. If SPY can break back through there and close over that level tomorrow there actually could be a case made that today was some massive over reaction and we are going to see a reversion to mean break to the upside 385 range tomorrow. However, if we back test and reject 378.1 that is even more confirmation of downside to come. 

If you remember since last CPI the media was screaming a fed pivot and a fed slowing of rate hikes. Overall JPOW effectively just said that is NOT happening right now but in the future will happen. With that narrative now squashed where are we going to go next? The next thing on the Agenda is CPI on November 10th which so far we still do not have a consensus on core or CPI yet. However, monthly CPI is consensus of 0.7 which would be a 0.3% rise over previous MoM. I expect that CPI to release soon and I expect that could absolutely move the markets. 

Key support- 374.6 -&gt; 370.5 -&gt; 365

Key resistance- 378.1 -&gt; 379.9 -&gt; 384.1 -&gt; 388.6

Futures does not look any better then SPY and has broken through the red bull channel support also and landed at 3760 support. This will be the next support that bears what to try to take out. Bulls will look to get this back over 3865 by EOW if they want to remain bullish going forward. 

One major bearish thing we can take away here is that this week effectively was a daily 100ema rejection and now huge break down through daily 8 and 20ema. The bearish case is rising in strength. 

Key support- 3705 -&gt; 3675 -&gt; 3585

Key resistance- 3800 -&gt; 3865 -&gt; 3925

Apple actually was the last domino to fall today and even more interestingly about Apple it has officially broken through the bottom from Friday. That huge green day that Apple had on Friday is now completely gone and then some. 

With this bull channel now broken we are looking at downside obviously now too. It is hard to tell in this picture because if I zoomed out too far it would be hard to see the candles but we are actually seeing quite a bit of red. Looking at the daily you can see that 150.6 is the KEY pivot level of bullish vs. bearish and we are seeing a pretty aggressive rejection of the daily 100 and 200ema which I mentioned earlier would take a few trading days to play out. 

Key support- 144.7 -&gt; 141.1 -&gt; 138.2 

Key resistance- 149.2 -&gt; 150.6 -&gt; 153.4 -&gt; 155.4

They really did massacre my girl Tesla today. I was actually impressively bullish on tesla with that closure over key 230 and the candle body over the daily 20ema which fully closing over the daily 8ema. However, we just saw a pretty massive rejection of the daily 20ema today and closure just above key support at 214.9. 

Key support- 214.9 -&gt; 210 -&gt; 205.6

Key resistance- 219.4 -&gt; 225.8 -&gt; 229.9

What would a -2.5% red day on SPY be without the VIX closing barely green at 0.12%... Well I had imagined they were unwinding the VIX for FOMC and especially for CPI next week, however, I would have expected to see a reaction on the VIX especially with this dump. There is clearly still fear and unknown in this market thanks to JPOW today, however, the VIX didn’t really react. Will it react tomorrow? Or is this going to end up being a straight volume dump with VIX once again being detached? 

Daily log- 

Well I am going to start doing these a little differently! I am going to start a 2.5k 10% take profit/ 20% stop loss challenge. So EOD you will see me post my daily log and post results of a 2.55k challenge. I will probably end up making a separate post for the 2.5k challenge also. For me usually my first trade of the day is my best trade so I will utilize my first entry for the trade. I will use the full $2500 per trade (well as close as I can) and I will update this via Excel like my normal port. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1g4jz5ebqlx91.png?width=828&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05a2491de9d015a29655f9088fa96de3697abc0f

I will start the challenge tomorrow just going to move a few things around in my accounts. Now the thing with this is that it is NOT about full porting… that’s absolutely not what im doing this for and $5000 is not a full port for me. What I am doing instead is hoping to show you guys whether its $500, $1000, $2500, $10,000, etc. etc. If you have proper strategy and risk management and take small profits those small profits will add up over time. This is to show you compound growth. Yes one loss of 20% does set you back two 10% wins, but if you continue to trade the $2,500 it adds up and recovers fairly quickly. 

This is not a full port as I said… I will be utilizing $2,500 PER TRADE so as you see above the starting “balance” is $2,500 but that’s not all that is in there. In the future I may do another one of just one trade a day starting with like $5,000 or something in the account and attempt to grow that… the same premise remains though that as long as you maintain a good strategy one loss really only takes 2-3 trades to over come. With premiums being so ridiculous right now it’s a little hard to use less then $2,500 and even some days $2,500 will be a stretch but like I said it will be as close to $2,500 as it can be. 

I will continue to trade normally in my other account doing day traders/ scalps and of course my level to levels.

Not my best day but not my worse day. The important lesson today was no matter how highly probable a trade is… it can ALWAYS go against you and not only that… it is only a high probability trade if we remember to take profits. These trades that are the “big hitters” have to be lotto size and you have to understand that as you see above there is a chance it goes straight to zero.

9,wallstreetbets,Annual_Equipment_370,self.wallstreetbets,54,I'm pivoting,"Wow, I'm just gonna cash out, delete my brokerage app and forget about fucking stocks forever.  
This week I've accurately used my 3 pre-PDT trades to gain $500 and get rid of this status right before today's shitstorm. I was sitting in cash, 25.2k, just waiting for the FOMC, playing chess and thinking that I'm probably done for today unless market chooses a clear direction after the meeting. Then I see a notification on my phone. YOUR POSITION MAY BE LIQUIDATED.   


wat?  


I opened the app and saw that I'm fucking shorting SQQQ at 52.00 and it's 53.50 now. I forgot to cancel one of the stop orders and went short on margin. I freaked out, tried to cancel the trade via app support and set a buy order at 52.11. Eventually the position was closed at this price and I only lost like $50 on that. And a shitload on neurones.  


After I closed the position, I had a chat with my gf about all the situation, we freaked out, but I felt lucky to escape a potential infinite loss.   


So, happy end, huh? I've evaded PDT status by doing two good trades and dodged this short margin position liquidation.  


Well, after some time I saw a bunch of enormous green dicks on SQQQ chart, realised that market has decided to finally dump and I still can join the trend, bought some SQQQ at 56.00, with default stop loss at 55.00 and profit taker at 57.00. Right after my order was filled, the stonk started to tank. I felt stressed af. It was too much for today and just wanted to exit the trade, fuck off and chill till tomorrow. Instead of closing it with minimal loss, I just watched SQQQ dropped to 55, lost $500, received PDT status, then in half an hour SQQQ jumped to 58, and to 59 in another half an hour. So if I haven't initialised the trade, I would've been +$450 today. If I've sold at a $100 loss, I'd still be fine. If I've managed my stop loss according to volatility, I would've been + extra $1k at close.  


Instead, I'm banned from trading for 90 days. I just watch the market rapidly tanking, feel even more FOMO and self-hatred for being stupid enough to do some emotional trades after such a day and risking my 25k PDT limit. I can't deposit extra money to the account, because my Ukrainian bank doesn't allow me to send USD abroad due to war time restrictions.  


I was waiting for this fucking FOMC and upcoming 52w lows during this whole bullshit rally month, hoping to ride the SQQQ till SPY @ 360. Now I'm fucked, my plan is fucked, finances are fucked. Total loss: $5k. Not as devastating as some of you apes have, but painful enough, and I won't be able to manage this loss in the next 90 days, maybe never, I just feel sick from these fucking candles. Maybe I'll just buy virgin IVW in Feb and maybe will be able to cover my losses in 5 years with the help of cOmPoUnD iNtErEsT. If we won't die in fucking great nuclear war recession till then.  


What a life!

I held strong and had faith in JPOW.

# Final Comment

&amp;#x200B;

AMC is a heavily indebted company; the leverage is unsustainable, and the company is struggling to have positive net income. Its Cash Burning Rate is at 2.56, meaning its spending 2.5 times more its cash availability, giving the company a life expectancy of 30 moths with its current cash &amp; cash equivalents. It will need to cash in accounts receivables to extend more its life expectancy.

Income quality dropped drastically since 2018, it means that total earnings do not correspond to the actual cash intake from its operations.

Cash Ration indicate that the company will struggle to pay its current liabilities with its current cash.

Without  a drastic change in its fundamentals, the company is in high risk.

It is advisable to keep an eye on the Company operations and Management Action and evaluate possible adjustments for the final pricing without any changes in trends, the company is destined to die.

Long term forecast is more pessimistic than previously forecasted. 


IMO they will get interest rates close to core inflation and see how much it slows down inflation. Then they may increase it further for a full on recession to bring prices down by killing the economy. 


If core inflation does start going down through Q4 and early 2023, we will see slower rate increases. If stays high, we're going to 6% very fast.

71,wallstreetbets,predictany007,self.wallstreetbets,12,Fed approves 0.75-point hike to take rates to highest since 2008 and hints at change in policy ahead,"The Federal Reserve on Wednesday approved a fourth consecutive three-quarter point interest rate increase and signaled a potential change in how it will approach monetary policy to bring down inflation.

In a well-telegraphed move that markets had been expecting for weeks, the central bank raised its short-term borrowing rate by 0.75 percentage point to a target range of 3.75%-4%, the highest level since January 2008.

The move continued the most aggressive pace of monetary policy tightening since the early 1980s, the last time inflation ran this high.

Along with anticipating the rate hike, markets also had been looking for language indicating that this could be the last 0.75-point, or 75 basis point, move. Specifically, some Fed officials along with Wall Street economists and strategists in recent weeks had talked of a “step-down” in policy that could see a rate increase of half a point at the December meeting and then a few smaller hikes in 2023.

That language was not overt in the post-meeting statement from the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, though there was a tweak that could point to an adjustment in policy.

This week’s statement expanded on previous language simply declaring that “ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate.“

The new language read: “The Committee anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time.“

The statement reiterated that policy changes “will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.“

Markets will look to Chairman Jerome Powell’s news conference at 2:30 p.m. for more clarity on whether the Fed thinks it can implement less restrictive policy that would include a less dramatic level of rate hikes to achieve its inflation goals.

Along with the tweak in the statement, the FOMC again categorized growth in spending and production as “modest” and noted that “job gains have been robust in recent months” while inflation is “elevated.” The statement also reiterated language that the committee is “highly attentive to inflation risks.“

The rate increase comes as recent inflation readings show prices remain near 40-year highs. A historically tight jobs market in which there are nearly two openings for every unemployed worker is pushing up wages, a trend the Fed is seeking to head off as it tightens money supply.

Concerns are rising that the Fed, in its efforts to bring down the cost of living, also will pull the economy into recession. Powell has said he still sees a path to a “soft landing” in which there is not a severe contraction, but the U.S. economy this year has shown virtually no growth even as the full impact from the rate hikes has yet to kick in.

At the same time, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure showed the cost of living rose 6.2% in September from a year ago – 5.1% even excluding food and energy costs. GDP declined in both the first and second quarters, meeting a common definition of recession, though it rebounded to 2.6% in the third quarter largely because of an unusual rise in exports. At the same time, housing prices have plunged as 30-year mortgage rates have soared past 7% in recent days.

On Wall Street, markets have been rallying in anticipation that the Fed soon might start to ease back as worries grow over the longer-term impact of higher rates.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained more than 13% over the past month, in part because of an earnings season that wasn’t as bad as feared but also amid growing hopes for a recalibration of Fed policy. Treasury yields also have come off their highest levels since the early days of the financial crisis, though they remain elevated. The benchmark 10-year note most recently was around 4.04%.

There is little if any expectation that the rate hikes will halt anytime soon, so the anticipation is just on a slower pace. Futures traders are pricing a near coin-flip chance of a half-point increase in December, against another three-quarter point move.

Current market pricing also indicates the fed funds rate will top out near 5% before the rate hikes cease.

The fed funds rate sets the level that banks charge each other for overnight loans, but spills over into multiple other consumer debt instruments such as adjustable-rate mortgages, auto loans and credit cards.

Listen, Zuck MIGHT be an absolute regard and Meta MIGHT be the downfall of his company, but I hardly believe that’s the case. Take VR-chat for example, I have seen lots of people compare meta with vr-chat pointing out that there already is an existing product that currently, beats meta in regards to graphics and so on. But meta was and isnt meant to be like vr-chat. Vr-chat didnt change gaming or gaming trends in basically any shape or form. We still use our systems and most of us would never switch to vr when we have pc and other standard gaming consoles. So why would meta try to create an already existing product, which has proven to not be very successfull? Well I think the answer is simple, they’re not doing that. The massive spending everyone is constantly reffering to is obviously not spent on the graphics or how it ”looks”, but the engine and the software, that currently (as shown by vr-chat), is very underdeveloped. The product isnt and was never meant to be operational or used right now, but everyone seems to think that because of the massive spending, bad graphics and an unfinished product, meta is DOOMED. I believe that there is profound potential in the metaverse because of the massive spendings, not the other way around. People want groundbreaking technology that potentially could represent reality, but act suprised when it turns out the cost of such a system to be built, is massive. Regarded sheep mindset.

Rates in have to be above the rate of inflation. 

For example, if you get a mortgage at current rates, about 7% and the rate of inflation is at 8.1%, you are borrowing money at a rate that is lower than inflation, which is not considered restrictive, or that it is stiil cheaper to borrow vs the appreciation of a commodity or asset.

The dilemma that jpow faces, is the time lag theory, which states that for each rate hike, it takes at minimum 6 months for for it to effect in the economy. The totality of  the effects of the rate hikes will really not be known until mid 2023. So no one really knows what the actual effects of hikes will do.

&amp;#x200B;

All apple products are pricey things, including the iPhone, mac, iPad and everything.

Yes they are excellent products with absolutely outstanding performances compared to other products out in the market. Still, yet a LOT of people who buy apple products can save a fortune by picking other products other than the standard MacBook or the iPhone. But yet they have so much market monopoly going on all over the world with such products that will normally be considered quite expensive, to the extent this is almost baffling

&amp;#x200B;

Apple grew AGAIN in the latest quarter
(While all the other major companies mostly had an earnings shock) and I personally think this can only be explained by ""People paying for apple products again and again."" If apple was a growing company aspiring to eat up a lot of the marketplace in the future then the reason for their growth would be pretty obvious. But they're not. It's not like they're starting to insert ads within the ios to increase their revenue. Their one and only source of profit is (mostly) their Apple products. Phones, Laptops, and Tablets that are more than outstanding in quality but also have a significantly higher price tag compared to other products.

It's making people buy the same iPhone again and more (well, not the same but you can still work longer with your previous iPhone.). I don't think Apple would be able to grow this much if people only bought a single iPhone to replace their previous iPhone every three years when their iPhone finally dies.  For some reason they're making the same people buy so much apple products again although their extremely high price tag. Something like buying another iPhone in a shorter span. Or buying other Apple products as well after purchasing your iPhone. Adding a new Macbook in your shopping cart although your previous one is still good.

Seems like people LOVE the iPhone. Yes it's a cult, it's almost something like a new religion

&amp;#x200B;

They don't really have a lot of new customers out there to purchase their first iPhone. Yet the company is still GROWING. A LOT

&amp;#x200B;

Is it the marketing? Is it because of product quality?

25,wallstreetbets,predictany007,self.wallstreetbets,16,Amazon has exited the trillion-dollar club. Sell-off pushes market cap below $1 trillion for first time since April 2020," 

* Amazon’s stock closed down Tuesday for a fifth straight day, falling to the lowest since April 2020.
* Last week the company projected sales in the holiday quarter would be far below expectations.
* The stock dropped 5.9% to $96.79.
* Amazon has exited the trillion-dollar club.

Shares of the e-retailer plunged 5.9% on Tuesday, falling for a fifth straight day and closing at their lowest since April 2020. The sell-off has erased almost all of the stock’s pandemic surge.

Investors continued to punish the company for last week’s disappointing fourth-quarter forecast. Amazon said revenue during the holiday quarter would grow 2% to 8% over the year-ago period, far below analysts’ estimates. The cloud division, Amazon Web Services, also reported weaker-than-expected sales.

It’s the first time Amazon’s market cap has been below $1 trillion since April 2020. The stock has plunged 42% in 2022 and is on pace for its worst year since 2008, when it dropped 45%. The only other year that was worse was during the dot-com crash of 2000, when the company lost 80% of its value.

Like the rest of Big Tech, Amazon has struggled this year due to a slumping economy, soaring inflation and rising interest rates. On top of that, Amazon has been forced to scale back after expanding dramatically during the pandemic, now that consumers have returned to stores.

Amazon has been the second-worst performer in the Big Tech group this year, behind Facebook parent Meta, which has plummeted 72%. Meta told investors last week that revenue in the fourth quarter would likely decline for a third straight period.

Captivating **TL;DR** today - **number go up.** Purchases are u**p 345% ($4.9M to $22M)** from the prior week along with sales, which increased +290% ($263M to $1B). The bulk of purchases stems from insiders at Mobileye Global Inc within the IT sector / Electronic Equipment industry. Active insiders and companies are up 18% and 25% respectively from the prior week.

# High-Level Stats:

* Purchases increased from $4.9M to $22M (+345%)
* Sales increased from $263.5M to $1.02B (+290%)
* Transactions increased from 267 to 316 (+18%)
* Companies represented in Form 4s increased from 170 to 200 (+18%)
   * Net buyers increased from 14 to 23 (+64%)
   * Net sellers increased from 156 to 177 (+13%)
* Insiders filing Form 4s increased from 234 to 292 (+25%)
   * Net buyers increased from 25 to 38 (52%)
   * Net sellers increased from 209 to 254 (+22%)

# Transaction Selection

1. **All** **Direct Open Market Transactions** from **October 24th - October 28th.** These are Form 4 filings with a Transaction Code of “P” or “S”. This narrows the scope to trades where insiders are putting their money on the line.
2. Weekly comparisons are to transactions from **October 17th - October 21st.**
3. **No companies without a ticker** (e.g. opportunity/income/mutual funds).

# Further Context

1. Form 4 data is impacted by a concept known as **backfill** which is par for the course with transactional data. The delay between the Filing Date and the Transaction Date is **\*roughly\*** 2 days and your mileage will vary. This means that **more transactions for past dates can arrive in future filings.** That is why looking at larger trends is key.
2. To combat backfill, filings through this Tuesday are included **\*if\*** the transaction date is from the prior week. Otherwise, transactions from this week are excluded.
3. Data is sourced by the algorithms behind [Form Fore](http://formfore.io/)

# Feedback/Updates

* All feedback, **good bad, and ugly** are welcome - aiming to make these as helpful as possible.
* The **public workbook** should be ready for initial release **sometime next week**. Will also share on Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/FormFore) if that is your preferred hub.
* The newsletter is likely a few weeks out and on my radar. I appreciate your patience!

37,wallstreetbets,Fuego1050,self.wallstreetbets,6,AMERICAN Cannabis Companies could follow Canopy’s Structure to Up-List on the Toronto Stock Exchange - Third Largest in World - MSOS ETF,"https://mjbizdaily.com/could-american-marijuana-companies-follow-canopy-growth-to-toronto-stock-exchange/

(TRULIEVE, VERANO, GREENTHUMB, CRESCO, CURALEAF) 

Ontario, Canada-based licensed cannabis producer Canopy Growth’s plans to launch Canopy USA to accelerate its acquisitions of three American marijuana companies and remain listed on a major stock exchange might have provided a blueprint for U.S. companies.

American cannabis operators who touch the plant could follow the Canopy road map to uplist from the Canadian Securities Exchange to the Toronto Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq – provided they’re willing to do a major restructuring, experts told MJBizDaily.

The upside to listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), North America’s third-largest exchange, is that it could help cannabis companies attract more institutional investment.

So far, American plant-touching cannabis companies – such as multistate operators – haven’t been able to raise capital on major exchanges because of the federal illegality of cannabis in the U.S., opting instead to list on the Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE) and over-the-counter markets.

And that might still be a problem, at least for the Nasdaq, which expressed objections to Canopy’s plans and could delist the Smiths Falls-based company.

But the TSX has been more receptive, which could provide U.S. plant-touching operators an avenue for uplisting without waiting for the federal government to legalize marijuana or implement other major cannabis reforms.

In an email to MJBizDaily, Catherine Kee, spokesperson at TSX parent TMX Group, confirmed that Canopy worked directly with the exchange and shared its plans in advance of the announcement.

Kee declined to comment on whether U.S. companies could follow.

“We are aware that legislation applicable to the marijuana sector is evolving,” Kee said. “TMX continues to monitor the developments with interest and we remain committed to supporting the enduring success of the cannabis industry.”

In a note, equity analyst Owen Bennett of New York-based investment bank Jefferies Group wrote that the Toronto Stock Exchange’s approval of a Canopy listing could have major implications for U.S. operators through more M&amp;A by Canadian acquirers and/or enabling “U.S. (operators) to adopt the same structure and uplist to the TSX.”

Restructuring ‘gymnastics’
Kelly Fair – a partner with the international law firm Dentons and external counsel to Canopy’s new holding company Canopy USA – told MJBizDaily she’s proud of the creative approach she and the Canopy team have taken to accelerate U.S. market exposure.

Canopy USA will have a ring-fenced structure in which Canopy Growth would hold nonvoting, exchangeable shares in the holding company, segregating those U.S. assets from the rest of the company.


“To the extent that the substructure is embraced by at least the TSX, then that would provide the opportunity to the U.S. (multistate operators to uplist) potentially sooner than a full legalization event – if they wanted to go through the gymnastics to do structuring like this,” Fair said.

Any MSO looking to uplist would have to create a ring-fenced structure between the listed company and the company that’s actually touching the plant or holding the plant-touching entities, she said.

The pros and cons

Matt Karnes, founder of Greenwave Advisors, told MJBizDaily via email that the TSX is more expensive to list on than the CSE, but that it has more liquidity and more stringent listing requirements – which are both more appealing to institutional investors.

He also said Canopy could try to use TSX approval to pressure the Nasdaq to allow U.S. plant-touching businesses to list.

Another hitch, however, is whether Canopy’s auditors will sign off on consolidated financials that include plant-touching operations in the U.S.

“The Big 4 (accounting firms) have not engaged in U.S. cannabis thus far and this could signal a willingness to accept U.S. cannabis clients – a positive for U.S. cannabis as it gives added assurance to institutional investors as to the industry’s legitimacy,” he said.

Whatever happens, Karnes  believes U.S. multistate operators will follow Canopy’s lead, particularly if they don’t want to wait for legislation such as the Safe and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act that could pass during this lame-duck session of Congress.

“I think whatever path Canopy Growth USA takes, the MSOs will follow, and they don’t necessarily have to wait to see what happens with SAFE.”

39,wallstreetbets,Suspicious-Word-9514,self.wallstreetbets,19,"Macroscope | The Fed meeting preview: 4th 75bps rate-hike is on the way, is pivot coming next?","The Fed's two-day November meeting will end on Wednesday, and the market has well expected its fourth consecutive aggressive 75 basis point rate hike, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. The probability of a 75 basis point rate hike has reached as high as 85.5%, which would raise the federal funds rate to a range of 3.75%-4%, the highest level since 2008.

However, given the recent signals released by the Fed to slow down interest rate hikes, the market is likely to be more concerned about further signals from the Fed after the rate meeting on plans for a December rate hike and the direction of monetary policy next year. The Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has been vocal about the need to slow the pace of interest rate hikes at some point since July, and analysts believe he may also reiterate that point at this meeting. Additionally, a report by the ""New Fed Wire"" last week about the possibility of a slowdown in the Fed's aggressive policy in December continued to gather steam, with medium and long-term US bond yields topping out after hitting yearly highs.

Bloomberg economists said what is less certain is how Powell will communicate a potential future downshift in the rate-hike pace -- the degree of conviction, the risks around hike sizing, and implications for the terminal rate. Economists expect Powell to use 50 basis points present a 50-basis-point move as the base case and clarify that a downshift in the pace of rate hikes does not necessarily mean a lower terminal rate.

It is worth noting that the Fed’s November meeting is also just less than a week before the US mid-term elections. Undoubtedly, how to deal with the Republicans on the high-rise inflation and the risk of recession will become a major problem for Biden. And just last week, two Democratic senators urged Powell not to cause unnecessary pain by over-raising interest rates.

It has been said that there are now major divergences within the Fed on monetary policy. For example, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daley thinks the Fed should start discussions on slowing down rate hikes to avoid sending the economy into an ""unforced slump"". But Kansas Fed President Esther George believes that monetary policy needs to move into a restrictive range, and the strength remains to be watched. Given the recent volatility in the financial markets and the time it takes for interest rate hikes to affect the economy, the Fed cannot act too hastily.

There are also a few views that do not favour a pivot. Fed governor Michelle Bowman hopes to look for signs of falling inflation before slowing down the rate hike. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said he hopes to raise the policy rate to a level that would put meaningful downward pressure on inflation.

Therefore, for this meeting, FOMC members are expected to engage in a heated debate on how to steer interest rates to avoid a troubled economy.

“They may want to go slower just in the interest of financial stability,” said Julia Coronado, the founder of MacroPolicy Perspectives LLC. “It’s a challenge for messaging because they don’t want to ease financial conditions significantly. They need tight financial conditions to keep cooling the economy off. So he (Powell) doesn’t want to sound dovish, but he may want to go slower.”

Some institutions took a relatively cautious view. Nomura believes that the FOMC does not yet seem to have a consensus on the preferred size of a December rate hike, which will limit Powell's ability to provide guidance. The Fed chairman will reiterate that future policy will depend on economic data, including the two non-farm payrolls reports and, most importantly, the latest inflation data. Barclays also released a report saying that the Fed may leave its December policy options open, pending more information on inflation and tightening risks.

The [J.P. Morgan](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NYSE-JPM/) team, on the other hand, made relatively “accurate “predictions on the outcome of this meeting. Analysts believe the most likely scenario going to happen is a 75 basis point rate hike and a hawkish press release, which could allow Powell to retain selectivity for December and next year meetings, while highlighting the current risks of higher inflation. In this scenario, S&amp;P 500 may float between down 1% to up 0.5%. And if the Fed provides clear guidance for the December meeting, this is likely to be seen as dovish and S&amp;P 500 could rise by 2.5%-3%.

In addition, former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers also tweeted recently, saying that the “growing chorus” for the Fed to pause interest rate hikes very soon is “badly misguided.” In his view, the Fed should stick to its current course and not pause too soon, especially given that it has a history of “past errors”.

Aside from rate hikes, let's not forget the glooming recession hanging over the US. Concerns were fuelled last week by the inversion in the 3-month/10-year US bond yields. Prior to this, the 2/10-year US bond inversion had been going on for almost five months. Given the historically extremely high success rate of both yield curves in predicting crisis, there is growing concern about how the Federal Reserve will respond to outside concerns about the economy.

Notably, Jerome Powell had said in the press conference after the September meeting that the goal of fighting inflation had not changed and would be maintained until the task completed, and the federal funds rate would need to be kept at a restrictive level for a certain time. But the FOMC had already revised down the US economic growth rate to 0.2% this year.

It is worth noting that while consumers, the engine of the US economy, are still maintaining spending in the face of inflationary pressures, danger signals are beginning to reveal. The US Department of Commerce said last week that consumer spending growth slowed to a near two-year low of 1.4% from 2.0% in the previous quarter, and consumer purchasing power continues to retreat at a 3% rate and US families are gradually running out of federal financial subsidies in the COVID pandemic.",0.76,11,0,11,question,2022-11-02T14:27:47Z,yk3wmu,t3

54,wallstreetbets,asmit10,self.wallstreetbets,4,$CCJ - Uranium Miner trying to break out of a 8 year downtrend,"$CCJ

Camerco claims:

Uranium inventories are low

Secondary supply is low

Nobody has been investing in supply

‘never started a cycle with this high of a uranium price’

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Camerco appears to be a good steward of capital and understands the market dynamics involved with being a supplier of a not-so-rare mineral

Camerco had \~10% of world uranium production in 2021

China adding \~150 nuclear power plants by 2035

China’s nuclear power generation in the past 10 years has been so great - that it has made up for Europe’s staunch stance on decommissioning - leading to the largest nuclear power plant power generation of all time in 2021. It is conceivable that the west is beginning to realize their mistake and are beginning the process of fixing it, out of necessity from Russia’s and Saudi Arabia’s oil cartel.

Yes, oil manufacturing is going to spike. Oil supply will eventually outpace demand, the Russian war will end, and energy prices will stabilize…but with China investing so much into low-cost energy, will the west want to remain dependent on Russia for economic stability?

Even the most anti-nuclear governments are temporarily halting their decision to decommission 30 year old plants

200 - 400 nuclear power plants to be decommissioned by 2040

Camerco recently announced a deal to buy Westinghouse..

…and Poland just announced they’re building their first nuclear power plant and chose the U.S. and Westinghouse to build their first Nuclear Power Plant.

According to [World-nuclear.org](https://World-nuclear.org): 

About 90 power reactors with a total gross capacity of about 90,000 MWe are on order or planned, and over 300 more are proposed. Most reactors currently planned are in Asia, with fast-growing economies and rapidly-rising electricity demand.

&amp;#x200B;

Major uranium miners are seeing a demand increase in Uranium out to 2024 - and are subsequently significantly increasing production, including Camerco

Many western governments have started initiatives to support nuclear initiatives

Last quarter financial results showed negative earnings because they wrote off the expanse of restarting a mine. They previously shut the mine off due to poor uranium market performance.

Their main competitor is also increasing uranium production. They are both doing so based on contracts they’ve obtained and plan to obtain - neither seem to participate in the spot market in a material way.

&amp;#x200B;

Technically speaking, $CCJ has begun trying to break out of a major downtrend going back to 2014.

$CCJ Reiterated multiple times that they see strong profit going forward, and see production along with spot rates increasing. Given this, the Russian - Saudi oil regime, China's emergence as the nuclear energy super power, a massive reversal in short-term power plant decomissioning, the global incentive to go nuclear (Low long term cost, removal of complete reliance on oil, 'going green'), and  the material fact that Western governments have begun to spend money supporting this thesis...

&amp;#x200B;

Do you guys have any thoughts?

&amp;#x200B;

I'll leave with a headline I found:

Article dated: 6 Oct 2022

# No nuclear power ‘renaissance’ as Europe wrestles energy crisis

""...But after eight months of fighting in Ukraine, and an energy crisis compounded most recently by the alleged sabotage of the arterial Nord Stream 1 and 2 Russia-to-Europe pipelines in the Baltic Sea, European governments long opposed to nuclear power have shown only incremental shifts in their attitudes, which have been informed by years of concerns about nuclear waste and safety.

&amp;#x200B;

A wider pivot has remained absent.

&amp;#x200B;

“We’re not talking about a nuclear renaissance, as such,” Nicolas Berghmans, an energy and climate expert at the France-based Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations (IDDRI), told Al Jazeera, “but maybe more of a change of tide.”

&amp;#x200B;

“A real nuclear renaissance would be if Europe decides to invest in more nuclear power plants.”""",0.84,9,0,9,dd,2022-11-02T10:50:05Z,yjzuta,t3

u/Infamous_Sympathy_91 's [post on credit card debt and personal savings from earlier today](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yjowp1/us_personal_savings_near_historic_lows/)


In 2020 money stopped moving. I wrote this in some of my previous posts and comments. In order to prop up economic activity, central banks increased money supply with almost 0 interest a.k.a Brrrrrr.

So ideally fresh minted money is distributed in the real economy and moves up and trickles down and so forth. As you can see in the chart above, money hasn't been moving as much in the economy since the peak in 2000; It's in constant decline with a hard fall in 2020.

Today central banks are trying to battle inflation. As you can see in the chart above, money isn't moving as much, so it's not that there is too much money in the real economy. Whatever they printed in the last 2 years went up to the big black void of finance. All the derivatives market, swaps, trenches and all sorts of made up bullshit has sucked up money faster than your wife sucking her boyfriend's cock.

Inflation is a product of price gauging and artificial crises, such as cutting down oil production, slowing down logistics around the globe, lagging or harsh response to the pandemic by governments etc.

What you're seeing with the interest rate increases will only hit small businesses and working people. Casino always wins. Banks will own everything. You will own nothing at the end of this.

In the next two years, you will lose your jobs, you will lose your homes if you have debt. You will start selling your assets until capitalism owns your ass. We had reached a point of multi-generational wealth with too many high net worth individuals. Those who are pulling the strings are actively sabotaging the economy and are robbing you.

The interest rates will once again go down, when most people lose everything and you can't borrow anymore. This isn't about bringing the inflation down by decreasing money spent in real economy. The chart in the link clearly shows you that there is no increased activity which would increase velocity of money.

So tomorrow or in the next year don't get your hopes up too much. Your average working class ape is in more debt than before and savings are at an all time low. The latest surge in house prices also guaranteed that banks and through them the central banks owns you.

This is the final stage of capitalism. Good luck to you all.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%. (Stats as of 2022-10-28)",0.8,12,0,12,dd,2022-11-02T03:10:54Z,yjr9oh,t3

So you like to make money fast? Is your motto Lambo or food stamps? This it’s for you. At 2 PM ET FOMC announcement made. A large price movement occurs at this time , this movement creates a fair gap value , as Powell starts to speak at 2:30 ET a counter move starts to test price movement created at release of hike announcement occurs. This can easily 2x-4x your 0 dte SPY option if it goes well if it doesn’t you lose 100% of your initial gamble I mean investment. This same pattern has occurred for the last two years . It doesn’t guarantee that it will happen again. Risky scalp with large potential for profit/losses. Just to reiterate if price has a large move up at 2 pm ET than just before 2:30 ET buy puts, if price has a large move down at 2 pm ET than just before 2:30 ET buy calls .

The interesting thing about today is that VOLD (volume) actually came in bullish at open and through the whole day pretty much until right before power hour VOLD was actually in extreme bull momentum. Now SPY could not break out and break away from 385 level. The thoughts are we either watched markets be held up by volume or there was just some weird stuff going on today. There was some dark pool prints hitting the tapes again today. 

The other interesting thing that I noted today is that this is the first time that the day before FOMC the VIX has been red (and especially didn’t spike) since the June FOMCs. The last two FOMCs were the first with a spike of the VIX the day before. 

What does that mean ? well im not quite sure but those months of FOMC were more bullish.

We also have quite a few articles released today saying that Biden supports a pivot of the fed (this was later slightly walked back though). 

My initial thoughts on what to expect tomorrow is that JPOW drops a 75bps (I would be SHOCKED to see a 50bps) but then he should hint at a “we will remain data dependent but there is a case to slow hikes if we continue to see optimism and to fully evaluate the effects of rate hikes.” 

But tomorrow will be interesting to say the least!

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ig9cg0t6hex91.png?width=773&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=358cc3b9af8b4e8c28541c1fa6b63f0f176b3cad

This TA is going to be pretty brief as markets gonna move however the algos want it to with FOMC. 

But overall we did attempt to breakout over 390.1 resistance of the green channel. With that pretty stout rejection we are not finding support which we did find almost all day at 385. This could if we get a green day tomorrow also be seen as a nice daily 8ema/ 50ema support test. In addition I am seeing that the 8ema is crossing back over the 50ema (bullishly) for the first time in two months. 

The rejection at 390.1 also was a rejection of the daily 100ema which im not super surprised by as this level is usually a bigger fight. Markets will need the push from good FOMC news tomorrow to break through these key levels and breakout until CPI. 

Key support- 380.1 -&gt; 377.8 -&gt; 374.1

Key resistance- 388.6 -&gt; 390.1 -&gt; 393 -&gt; 397.8 (my potential target for a bullish FOMC)

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at futures we have actually had this pattern play out just last week where we found support and managed to push up for an extreme green day. 

With a rejection of that 200ema today and that 3925 level that will remain key resistance and we will look for that level to be closed over tomorrow to continue to be bullish. 

Key support- 3845 -&gt; 3800

Key resistance- 3885 -&gt; 3925 -&gt; 3975

Apple has nearly retraced all the way back to where it was Friday before that massive rip on earnings. I wish I woulda been smart enough to short it Friday at market close. Apple was able to back test and hold the daily 8/50ema support lines today, however fell and closed under the 100/200ema. 

Key support- 148 -&gt; 146

Key resistance- 153.4 -&gt; 155.7 -&gt; 157.4

Tesla actually had a pretty nice pop today and broke through (but failed to close over) a key level. I was mentioning as you can see that 205 to 230 red channel on tesla. With this break through I am actually looking at an upside move on tesla (despite FOMC). 

This is its first time its broken through key 230 resistance since October 7th. We still have not closed over 230 though but as long as tesla holds over its daily 8ema and continues to hold this red bull channel I will remain bullish on it. 

Key support- 230 -&gt; 224.8 -&gt; 219.2

Key resistance- 234.2 -&gt; 239.6

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mmpr6qc9hex91.png?width=503&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58c636921894dc187d9689ff9e4c84edfd019809

As I had mentioned this is the first FOMC since June that the VIX has not popped significantly the day before. To me this means markets are bullish. I think that anything super hawkish for the FOMC tomorrow especially if he says 75bps in December the VIX is going to spike like no other and we could very well end up with a huge red day. However, I remain bullish and I think JPOW wont say anything to tip the markets down tomorrow. 

10% challenge-

Overall today was yet again another untradeable day after the first big move. Was able to get some nice scalps in today. And with an average down on my SPY and Tesla puts this morning at open I was able to close the SPY level to level puts for green and close the Tesla level to level puts for a smaller loss (they were very red at open). I don’t like DCAing to win a play like that but I didn’t expect that massive pre-market and with SPY holding under and beginning to dump off the key 390.1 resistance at open I felt confident in the DCA.

\- He found a high correlation between the two in democratic countries that had a free press and independent parties measuring the numbers

\- He found a large discrepancy between the two in autocratic regimes that controlled the reporting agencies and the press (shocker!)

\- Tested his theory against reasons why totalitarian countries might have fewer lights when experiencing massive economic growth (hey! they like working and living in the dark! They're allergic to electricity! They care more about the environment!). Nothing seemed to stand up to scrutiny.

\- Based on the growth in lights, he estimates that China's growth was less than half what they claimed. This means that China's GDP is likely less than half of the US rather than nearly equal

\- The other side of the coin is that their total debt levels might be between 600-700% of GDP rather than 300%

\- Paper has been peer-reviewed and presented at multiple economic conferences

20,wallstreetbets,KoGamer01,self.wallstreetbets,21,Fed Pivot? How I'm Playing it.," 

TLDR- we could go higher but we have more uncertainty in the near future as opposed to the last 2 weeks.

Some important dates to keep in mind:

Nov. 2nd- FOMC day

Nov. 10th- Oct. CPI data

Cant post the chart cus VisualMod keeps on taking it down.

Simple as seeing the last bear market rally and then applying it to now. We saw a rising wedge form on the monthly chart which is happening now. If the fed says it will indeed be ""kinder and gentler"" in any way shape or form you better bet your bottom dollar we will go to 408. However, on the off chance, the Fed says it will continue to bring more pain all your calls will be worthless in a few days. Now keep in mind that Oct. CPI will also determine if we continue to keep going higher even after a Fed ""pivot"". If CPI comes in hot we could see a similar drop back down to 350.

My plan- Wait till FOMC to see if the fed is indeed going to be kinder and gentler. If so buy $400 calls then take out my initial before CPI and if CPI is hot buy $360 puts.",0.61,6,0,6,dd,2022-11-01T21:44:03Z,yjj173,t3

**price\_efficiency:** how much are you losing to the bid/ask spread? Higher number the better. 

**expected\_move:** this is a percentage of the expected move, as priced by the ATM calls and puts, for this stock by expiration date (this Friday)

How to use this in your trading? 

Do you think **DASH** will move more than 14% by Friday? If not, sell options. If you think it will move for than that, I guess you might want to go long (debit) an option (not recommended). 

Do you want to trade **INTC**? Notice how the put\_IV is double that of calls. That means traders are bidding up the puts, and bidding down the calls relative to each other. If you think its going up, sell those puts and buy the calls. 

Want to trade **SBUX**? Realize that you will lose roughly 2% immediately when filling your trade and another 2% immediately when you exit. This is how the bid/ask spread works.

* The comments do not necessarily signal any pending actions against TikTok.
* The Treasury and Justice Departments are the ones leading a review and negotiations with the company.

Shares of U.S. social media companies Snap and Meta spiked on the news that a Federal Communications Commissioner said the U.S. government should ban TikTok.

“I don’t believe there is a path forward for anything other than a ban,” Republican Commissioner Brendan Carr told Axios in an interview.

Snap shares were up 6% and Meta shares were up 4% Tuesday afternoon.

The comments from Carr, one of four current commissioners at the Democrat-led agency, do not necessarily signal any pending actions against TikTok.

The Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS) in the Treasury Department is reviewing the company’s potential national security implications, given its ownership by a Chinese company, ByteDance. And the Department of Justice is the one leading negotiations over a security deal, The New York Times reported in September.

Concerns over TikTok’s potential security risks are generally bipartisan. Both the Trump and Biden administrations have expressed concerns and reviewed the company’s relationship with its Chinese owner. TikTok has maintained that it stores U.S. user data outside of China so that it would not have to turn over that information to the government, but U.S. officials have maintained their skepticism.

“Commissioner Carr has no role in the confidential discussions with the U.S. government related to TikTok and appears to be expressing views independent of his role as an FCC commissioner,” a TikTok spokesperson said a statement.

For those non-gamers out there Turtle Beach is like the HTC smart phone of the gaming headset/accessory market. It is essentially universally hated. Let's remember consumer spending is down, much larger and more diverse competitors in this space are down, tech companies in general down.

**If LOGITECH is hurting TURTLE BEACH is near fatal condition**

This was Logitechs last quarterly report...

Net Income: **-41.13%**

Net Profit Margin: **-33.15%**

Top line revenue: **-12.04%**

This was Turtle Beach ($HEAR) last quarterly report...

Net Income: **-1,135.79%**

Net Profit Margin: **-2,070.78%**

Top line revenue: **-47.43%**

All this being said you must remember Logitech is a much larger company approx. 80 times the size of Turtle Beach. with a **much greater range of products.**

Sounds like Turtle Beach needs to create a much diverse range of products to compete... Well that's exactly what they have been doing although they didn't realize the recession was just around the corner. They have expanded their product line into smartphone gaming controllers, XLR microphones, and flight simulator controllers. I believe/hope that their upcoming quarterly report on 11/3 after market is abysmal. **Just check out the open interest on $7 11/18 PUTS.**

79,wallstreetbets,predictany007,self.wallstreetbets,38,President Biden to float windfall tax on U.S. energy producers. Do you think it will affect energy stocks?," 

* Shares of refiners, oil producers drop after news report
* AP reported windfall tax is being considered by White House

President Joe Biden will call on Congress to consider tax penalties for oil and gas companies accruing record profits, according to a White House official, amid stubbornly high gasoline prices that are dragging on Democrats’ midterm prospects.

This could include a so-called windfall profit tax -- which Democrats have been proposing for more than a decade without success. The idea has renewed attention among progressives in Congress after gasoline prices spiked to more than $5 a gallon this summer.

Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat and Biden ally who chairs the tax-writing Finance Committee, has floated a proposal that would impose a new federal surtax on oil companies that record a profit margin better than 10%.

The White House official didn’t confirm that Biden would specifically call for the windfall tax after AP reported earlier Monday that he would. Biden will press oil and gas companies to invest their profits in lowering costs for Americans, the official said.

The president is scheduled to deliver remarks Monday afternoon, according to the White House, on “reports over recent days of major oil companies making record-setting profits even as they refuse to help lower prices at the pump for the American people.”

Biden also could reiterate his request for Congress to eliminate a slew of tax incentives enjoyed by the industry, including a deduction of intangible drilling costs, which allows oil and gas companies to immediately deduct some expenses, such as labor, site preparation and repairs.

Administration officials have weighed a number of other steps to encourage oil refiners to keep more gasoline and diesel inside the US, instead of exporting it, as domestic stockpiles shrink ahead of winter. New restrictions on the export of finished fuels, including diesel, could be imposed administratively.

Oil industry trade groups have argued a windfall tax would penalize domestic energy and fuel production right when the US should be encouraging more of both.

“Rather than taking credit for price declines and shifting blame for price increases, the Biden administration should get serious about addressing the supply and demand imbalance that has caused higher gas prices and created long-term energy challenges,” American Petroleum Institute President and Chief Executive Officer Mike Sommers said in a statement.

“Today, the president is proposing to raise taxes on the U.S. natural gas and oil industry that is competing globally to produce the fuels Americans need every single day.”

The S&amp;P 500 Energy Index initially erased a 2% gain after the news broke but partially recovered trading up 0.9% at 2:04 p.m. in New York. Refining stocks led the declines.

The Biden proposal resembles measures that politicians across Europe, and in some other countries such as India, are imposing on companies reaping record profits from fossil fuels and power generation. Mostly, those governments are using cash raised from windfall taxes to help subsidize soaring energy bills for households.

Critics of such plans say they’ll deter companies from making the kind of investments that are crucial for increasing supply, and keeping prices down, in the future -- a charge that may have more traction in the US, which unlike most European countries is itself a major oil and gas producer.

According to the SEC’s order, Compass repeatedly assured investors in 2017 that a technology upgrade at its Goderich mine – the world’s largest underground salt mine which is located near Ontario, Canada, and hailed by the company as its crown jewel – was on track to materially reduce costs and boost its operating results starting in 2018. **Compass’s statements were misleading because they failed to tell investors that costs at the mine were increasing rather than decreasing, which substantially undermined the projected savings.** The SEC also found that Compass misled investors by overstating the amount of salt it was able to produce at Goderich.

The SEC’s order found that Compass violated the antifraud, reporting, and internal controls provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and various related rules.

EQT which was founded in 1888, is one of the oldest stocks. The majority of analysts (77%) are bullish on the energy company, and they expect the stock to rally 56% from there. Analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a report last month that ETO-Top's risk-reward setup was the ""best"" among its peers heading into the winter this year.

As Europe’s gas price skyrocketing for the year and oil price globally has risen substantially this year due to the war in Russia and Ukraine providing tight supply. Europe could be headed for tough winters for the next 10 years and the supply shortages are likely the keep natural gas prices on a volatile upswing. The EQT should be benefited from tight supply and strong demand from Europe.

General Motors comfortably beat earnings expectations last week, but revenue was slightly below expectations and it maintained its full-year outlook. Either way, GM reported profits a full 20 percent higher than expected, triggering the rally in GM shares. The stock rose 3.6% on earnings day and is up 6.8% in the three trading days since the results were released.

TDLR: this pump was fueled by Japanese QE, White House is increasing inflation along with Japanese. Fed will be more aggressive to win, we all know the fed don’t lose




so everyone n their mother thinks we’re up because “pivot rumors” reality is when the pivot news dropped, market went green for a few minutes then shat the bed and ran red. then a certain something happened that made us run green and started this rally. It was BOJ interventions. BOJ (bank of Japan) dumped a whopping 40-50 billion dollars that morning so they can save the collapsing yen. Granted they were and partially still in denial about the whole interference as far as I can tell but they do assure y’all that they are “monitoring the markets” and they balance sheet keeps shrinking at a rather rapid pace.

So far off my estimates (too lazy to go pull up balance sheet) but I believe it’s around 200 billion that they have dumped into the markets since “bottom” was in. to put this into perspective, QT is burning slightly under 100bil a month and these guys just wiped out 2 months worth of hard effort and pain that the fed was trying to inflict in around 3 weeks time.

And there’s no sign of them stopping….. 

Their balance sheet is slightly over a trillion so they can keep this going on for a while.


THE CONSPIRACY

This whole operation along with “pivot” rumors are all well too damn coordinated. First off, we won’t see a pivot, CORE cpi was flaming hotter than Japanese pornstars. core PCE while came under estimates; it is still rising and there’s no sign of slowdown. So ask me again, why would they pivot or even hint at a pivot? 
It’s well known the White House has been begging Powell to go easy this meeting because of the election and u bet Powell is not being swayed. If politics were to get involved Powell is a republican and he’s on his last term so if anything he’s delivering more pain. But we all know Powell is here for the American people so I think he’s just gonna do what he had already planned and that is to just do his job and crush inflation. This is his chance to go down in history like Volker did. So I think the White House likley phoned the Japanese and begged them to dump dollars or someshit idk but this was all too well coordinated of a pump. The treasury(White House) is issuing an extra 150bil in debt above estimates. They are all adding to inflation trying to counteract the fed ahead of the elections.


this is why even if Powell had 75bps planned he will be forced to go with 100bps. They can’t increase QT since it’s really very close to max in terms of liquidity drain vs bank reserves. leaving the only option as more aggressive hikes to fight off the democrats and Japanese coordinated attacks against the fed. 


I think even with 100bps it’ll take some time to bleed the Japanese dry if they keep fighting so we can go on for months green if BOJ is willing to drop all 1 trillion that it has but I’m pretty certain they’ll stop once the election ends cuz it is coordinated after all to just spoof the markets for better votes in favor of the democrats",0.76,38,0,38,question,2022-11-01T13:37:05Z,yj6djm,t3

There’s one inflation gauge that bucks the trend

The New York Fed’s often overlooked UIG believes US inflation is past its peak


Whenever there’s an economic consensus on anything, it’s worth considering how it might be wrong. There seems to be general agreement that inflation and rates will be higher for longer, and “team transitory” has been defeated. But what if we are at an inflection point on inflation? This is the question policymakers should be asking. By one key measure, inflation in the US has already peaked. In fact, it peaked in March, the same month that the Federal Reserve began raising the benchmark rate.

The New York Fed’s underlying inflation gauge has largely been ignored for decades. That’s understandable, and not just because of the snoozer of a name. There wasn’t any significant underlying inflation in the years after the global financial crisis. While the Fed and financial markets are fixated on the 2 per cent inflation target, the UIG isn’t primarily a level forecast. Its real value is in predicting inflection points. It correctly anticipated the lasting high inflation we are now observing. And while it’s still high, the UIG is suggesting it will be abating.

The media and the public are obsessed with the consumer price index, while the Fed’s target is based on the personal consumption expenditures index. Both can be “noisy”, since they include the prices of volatile items such as energy and food. But they are not the only price measures. The Atlanta Fed tracks nine other indices(opens a new window) for inflation that aim to strip out noise. They show inflation somewhere between 4.7 and 7.3 per cent in September.

Most of these gauges remove data to try to identify underlying inflation. Core CPI excludes energy and food costs, for example, while trimmed mean and median measures strip out components with the largest changes in prices to smooth out the index. But the risk with these indices is that they can miss large price moves — up or down — that could be a signal of inflation changing direction.

The UIG is constructed differently, removing noise rather than items from the index. The idea is that movements in trend inflation happen alongside related changes in the trends of other economic and financial factors. The index looks at moves in prices, the labour market, financial markets and the real economy every month and checks the historical data going back to 1995 to see if similar moves had previously lasted at least a year. If so, they are included in that month’s UIG and if not, they are filtered out as noise.

You really can’t use the UIG to forecast the level of inflation, as has sometimes been suggested(opens a new window). Where it matters is in showing when the inflation trend is changing, and on this it has a decent track record in both normal and unprecedented times. When CPI hit a peak in 2018, for example, UIG clearly showed the peak while core CPI and trimmed mean and median indices suggested inflation would continue rising. In mid-2009, UIG showed a trough in inflation while the other measures took another year to reach a nadir.
What about during the pandemic? Core CPI did a good job of signalling a bottom for inflation in mid-2020 before rising, but dipped in the third quarter last year, wrongly suggesting that inflation would come down. The trimmed mean and median inflation indices failed to indicate a shift towards higher inflation, showing a trough more than six months after CPI and core CPI.

UIG found a bottom roughly in line with headline CPI and then started a steady climb upwards, rightly ignoring the slump in the third quarter of 2021. Of these metrics, it provided the earliest and most reliable signal for a rise in underlying inflation.

The Fed is now looking for signs that trend inflation has peaked and that monetary tightening is bringing inflation back towards its target. Much to its alarm, core inflation dipped in the second quarter of this year before accelerating in August and September. Median and trimmed mean inflation have been on a steady upward climb, with no signs of stabilisation. But the UIG peaked in March 2022, stabilised at high levels and has been gradually falling since July.

All the different gauges for inflation suggest it is way above the Fed’s target. But we know monetary policy works with long and variable lags, and there is a danger overtightening could spark a recession. The central bank aims to look through transitory factors and set policy based on the underlying trend. The UIG shows the trend is finally starting to reverse course.

**The top 2 challenges  and why they are going in favour of Bayer** 

**1) litgations 2) europe economy**

**European economy and the rise of the germans** 

**The dark winter**
- we all know European is heading into a difficult winter, although energy prices have gone down since i write this, it is no guarantee they will remain so. However, the germans are going to spend there way out of this winter and are poised to avoid a recession in 2023.

*it has already begun*

Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase. 



1) winter recession avoided 

https://m.ca.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/germany-dodges-recession-but-inflation-climbs-to-116-2811016

Why will it benefit the underlying stock? 

Spending - stocks go up in spending times bud. 

2) surprising growth,  will it be enough to outpace inflation ?  For 2023  Germany is likely to be okay, and Bayers product are essentials, during hard times Bayer makes money as well.

https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/short_news/germany-under-fire-for-canibalistic-e200-billion-investment/

3) relief plan makes  the EU  worried, if Germany avoid recession by spending, other European nations will want to follow the idea,  inflation cannot be controlled like this. EU therefore sounds the alarm and potential consequences, it is likely that not too many nations will follow suit in my opinion , Germany can afford to be spending, not many  European nations can, making Germany the exception, in fact if Germany being the biggest economy in Europe  makes it through, much of Europe will also make I through. 

The worried citi suggest the following 

*The proposals could cut 2 percentage points off inflation in the next year, according to Citi, but they are unlikely to prevent an economic contraction. The package “may soften the coming recession but also poses risks, in our view,” Citi analysts said in a note released last Friday.*

Why are we using words like economic contraction  all of a sudden instead of recession? 

https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/07/germany-relief-plan-could-trigger-uk-style-bond-meltdown.html
- **The litigations over roundup** and *glysophate*


 Bayer is still facing litigations due to the acquisition of Monsanto and RoundUp and during the last earnings call, Werner Baumann gave updated numbers. There are about 141,000 claims in total and about 108,000 have been settled.

Remember they have already set the cash aside, have won or litigated the majority of all cases. The rest are likely to head the same path.

Here is glysophate  surging 300% in 2021 https://www.agweb.com/news/crops/crop-production/glyphosate-prices-soar-much-300-and-thats-if-you-can-even-get-it

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic. This includes recent conclusions by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the EU’s Assessment Group on Glyphosate (AGG), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), and the leading health authorities in Germany, Australia, Korea, Canada, New Zealand, and Japan.

40,wallstreetbets,illikwid,self.wallstreetbets,25,How to trade 0dte options on FOMC Wednesday - A Regard's Perspective,"PHASE 0: 9:30-1:59:59

&amp;#x200B;

trading rangebound af.  0dtes swinging +/-10% on pure delta.  theta is frozen.  buy puts on your preferred index/etf at any time.  depending on your risk tolerance and the underlying, open a limit sell order for 1.5x-3x.  pussy with spy itms? get ur +50%.  lunatic on some otm spx? go for that +200% in 5 minutes u fucking god.

&amp;#x200B;

PHASE 1: 2:00:00-2:05 

 

i dont even wanna talk about what to do if its not 75bps but just in case...

100bps: do some sick euphoric dance and start howling.  then remember u set a limit order and lose your mind as you watch your 1.5x turn into free millionaire tickets.

50bps: cry and hope jpow starts levitating and speaking in tongues.  or maybe ur a maniac with a 4100 spx call hedge in case jpow starts handing out bags of cash instead of having a press conference.

&amp;#x200B;

75bps:

instant sentiment analysis on fomc statement finds ""pivot language"" to be largely absent.  spy down 1% in seconds, maybe making it all the way to -2%. your low-return sell order goes off in 10 seconds.  you clench and maybe walk around in a circle for 5 minutes.  your longer shots sell.

&amp;#x200B;

PHASE 2: 2:05-2:33  

&amp;#x200B;

conflicting narratives enter the picture.  the gamma recedes.  hopefully you're back in cash.  maybe you're in shambles cuz ur greedy limit just had its balls tickled.  we catch our breath and say, 'hold on, lets see what pow pows gonna say.  why are we down?  it was 75bps like everyone predicted.  that was priced in.  that was an overreaction, grab up this discounted shit quick.'  

market churns and claws back some to all of phase 1 losses.  pow pow takes his sweet ass time walking up to the podium and clears his throat...

&amp;#x200B;

PHASE 3: 2:34-2:4X

&amp;#x200B;

i dont know really. probably not much happens.  powell on his prepared remarks.  maybe he throws a hawkish jab or two, or sprinkles some grass for the bulls. hold on to ur cash.

&amp;#x200B;

PHASE 4: 2:4X-EOD

&amp;#x200B;

this is where we set momentum into jobs on friday.  powell opens some q+a.  first q probably some random bullshit that pow pow deflects heroically.  then maybe another softball, maybe a few more.  then some legendary lunatic reporter grabs the mic and says, 'YO JEROME YOU FUCKING PIVOTING OR WHAT?' powell takes a moment to collect himself, then states with volume and conviction we shall not pivot.  

now we're at another crossroads.  i'd say market starts selling right the fuck off.  but maybe, just maybe, we irrational bastards are so impressed by jpows stalwart leadership that we collectively decide an economy helmed by such a man must be infallible and head off towards the moon.

you could be in position before this pivotal (fuck you) line of questioning, hoping to predict the market reaction or do a spread if ur into that shit.  or you could wait a few minutes after jpow drops the mic for the direction to become clear and jump on it.  we're not changing direction til mid thursday at the earliest.  i wouldnt even call you a pussy if you bought a thurs / fri exp instead at this point and sold it late on thurs.  if you go with a 0 day roll that shit sometime 3:30-EOD.  

at least 3 percent up or down close on wed and an additional 1-3% move in the same direction on thursday.  

&amp;#x200B;

thats it.  if you made it this far, congratulations! for even considering trading on this perspective, you are now a more degenerate member of society.  even if we strike it big, we're gonna lose it soon or spend it on food accented with gold flakes, caviar, and our own tears.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%. (Stats as of 2022-10-28)",0.82,18,0,18,dd,2022-11-01T02:09:57Z,yitajz,t3

I have lost a lot like a lot of hard earned money in the past couple months. Last week, all I had left was $600, and I was looking on Friday Oct 28th at a Spy call (everyone was saying puts puts) but I just saw it and i was like this call this is it. But cause of all my past losses, I didn’t have the guts to press submit I just didn’t. And guess what, 2000% gains it went up 2000 frickin percent. I can’t believe I had it all was left just submit and at the end of day I could’ve gained 2000%. But I didn’t make it and I got even more scared cause I missed it cause I was scared. 

Anyway, today I was like I am not missing anything cause of fear, and I made two trades, both expired worthless so $600 is gone. 

I am sick of this. And it’s not like I just gamble. I calculate it and go for it, but I feel like the universe against me. Sometimes when I sell to break even it goes up later. And when I am like leave it let’s not just break even it will go up, no it goes down and down.

Thank you to u/80hz14 for posting this in the chat today… as you can see we have a few possible scenarios and outcomes for Wednesdays FOMC meeting. Overall I would say I am in the 75bps hike and a dovish presser where jpow hints at a 50bps in December. I think we should see a 3%+ green day on Wednesday. I would be pretty shocked with rising inflation to see JPOW drop a 50bps but honestly it could happen for other reasons.

Today we saw an extreme small range day (only 39% of the 10 day average) inside day that closed as a gravestone doji. With 388.6 remaining as resistance I will be looking for downside until SPY can break free and close over that resistance level. Today we did see that the 386/ 3880 level on futures was impressively strong support. Any time SPY came anywhere near that we would see a pretty impressive pop. 

Overnight and tomorrow those will be our clear “breakout/ down” levels. From there it depends on which way markets want take us. We very well could end up with an equally as annoying range day tomorrow. However, I wouldn’t be surprised to see a small pullback tomorrow down to the 380 range. The last few FOMCs the two days leading up to it have provided a small pullback. 

Key support- 385 -&gt; 380.1 -&gt; 378

Futures also had an extremely choppy overnight and intraday today. However, its daily char is closing with a double top right at 3910 and just under the daily 100ema resistance of 3925. With holding that key support of 3770 all day today we will look to those two key levels tomorrow to guide us on what direction we are going to be headed tomorrow. 

Its not impossible to believe that markets could rally tomorrow with hopeful whispers of FOMC on Wednesday but the historical trend would point to slight downside (risk off) leading into FOMC.

Key support- 3870 -&gt; 3845 -&gt; 3800

Not much of a surprise after that’s unbelievable Friday that Apple had we had a pretty nice pullback on Apple, although it looks more impressive than it actually was being that Apple only closed down 1.54%. 

Apple is at a key level right here fighting between the daily 200ema of 153.4 and the daily 100ema of 152.2. Historically when it comes to Apple interacting with the 200ema it is a fight that lasts for a few trading days as the daily 200ema on Apple is a major major pivot point. I have not seen too many times where it takes a straight trend line down or up over the daily 200ema. 

Key support- 151 -&gt; 148

Key resistance- 153.4 -&gt; 155.8 -&gt; 157.4

Tesla remains a tricky one to get a good read on, however, as you can see we are maintaining a pretty consistent red sideways consolidation channel from 205 to 230. We have now see our 4th day in a row of Tesla rejecting the daily 20ema and refusing to close over it. However, this is now the 4th day in a row that it has closed over the daily 8ema. As you can see we are in a pretty impressive red bull channel here, however, that blue resistance and red support lines are forming a really nice rising wedge. 

Until Tesla can breakout and most importantly close over the daily 20ema I remain bearish on it. My anticipation would be that we see a move one way or another tomorrow. Key support for that red bull channel is 224.8 tomorrow which is also the 3 day support line and previous resistance line. While its not impossible I would be surprised to see Tesla hold between 230 resistance 224.8 support. 

Key support- 224.8 -&gt; 219.3

I am actually surprised with FOMC in two days to see the VIX unwind more like it did today, however, the VIX actually had a really impressive spike at open and closed down with a nice inside day… one of those odd days where the 10year yield, DXY and VIX were all red and SPY was red. 

Some of the issue I saw today was that over all price action, volume and momentum opened pretty bearish this morning, however, the VIX continued to unwind and I believe that led to a lot of this choppy tight range price action. The VIX is currently holding right at the same level it was prior to last FOMC where the day before fomc closed at a VIX of 27.15. 

Overall no real sense of direction for SPY tomorrow as until FOMC happens the market in my opinion is not going to play nicely and not play by the technicals. 

FOMC day is setting up to be a really nice day for some nice wins, I have posted that TA and trade plan/ analysis. Make sure you give it a read! 

10% challenge-

Today was a really tough day for me today. Actual scalp wise I did do fairly well today, however, I had my level to level calls from Friday that I should have closed the Tesla calls green this morning (regrets) and I actually ended up closing them pretty early this morning when pretty much everything pointed to downside… only for them to pop up right after I closed them. If it wasn’t for those two woulda been a decent day despite the hard price action. 

I also thing that’s something that is going to catch this market by surprise here very soon and possibly even tomorrow for pretty much the last week or two now the price action of SPY in the mornings has been pretty bearish and has also been support by volume too. However, by 11ish we have seen a complete snap of trend and 180 reversal… today just chopped instead of broke out. I wonder if we get a slight sell off tomorrow as people get caught thinking its time to buy the morning weakness.

Closing out my most profitable month of the year and also one that I do not plan to attempt to beat. Great month with some great plays. Keeping in mind that my average % gain per trade was still only 12.7% for the month. This wasn’t so much about getting random massive winners… though I had some nice wins in there too… it was more about consistent small gains that have added up over time and most importantly limiting downside risk with a -20% stop loss. 

I posted my article about that this weekend but something to keep in mind is that just because I use a -20% stop loss on my scalps doesn’t mean that is right for you. You have to find what works for your strategy and your overall profits/ trade. The whole theory is though that you can have an extremely successful strategy but if one loser wipes out all of your weeks profits or numerous days of profits then you need to manage your risk better. It’s a balancing act of having a lose enough stop to not stop out too quickly (especially on my level to level plays) BUT not having such a big stop loss that it hits and the loss takes numerous trades to overcome.

Mostly for my own records but I am going to starts separating my scalps and my level to level trades from eachother and this month of November I really wanna analyze the comparison of them and everything more closely.

91,wallstreetbets,predictany007,self.wallstreetbets,18,JPMorgan Says Dovish Fed Could Spark The S&amp;P 500 To Rally 10% In One Day.,"While hopes for a less aggressive Federal Reserve helped US stocks overcome last week’s flurry of disappointing earnings from tech giants, JPMorgan Chase &amp;. Co.’s trading desk now sees room for a massive rally should policy makers turn dovish when they announce their decision on Wednesday.

The S&amp;P 500 could surge at least 10% in one day if the central bank raises interest rates by a slower-than-expected half of a percentage point, and Chair Jerome Powell signals willingness at the press conference to tolerate elevated inflation and a tightening labor market, according to the bank’s sales team including Andrew Tyler. The scenario is the “least likely” to materialize, yet the “most bullish” outcome for equity investors, the team wrote in a note to clients on Monday.

Laying out every possible scenario on Fed day, the JPMorgan team is embarking on a high-stakes task of predicting market moves based on an event that has largely been positive for stocks this year. Of the six prior meetings, the S&amp;P 500 rose four times on Fed day and fell on the other two, according to Bloomberg data.

To be sure, the bank’s economists expect the Fed to boost rates by another three-quarters of a percentage point, in line with the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey, and Tyler’s team views other scenarios as less likely. Still, the exercise offers a lens into the risks that investors are grappling with.

“These outcomes are skewed to the upside as our view is that last week the market had every reason to retest lows given the disappointment from megacap tech earnings and still moved higher,” noted Tyler and his colleagues. “Several client conversations have focused on trying to identify who is the incremental seller; we think the risk/reward is to the upside.”

Below are the scenarios from the JPMorgan team on how the S&amp;P 500 could react on Fed day.

* 50 basis point hike, with a dovish press conference: “It is difficult to conceive of a scenario where this outcome occurs given inflation levels and a tight labor market,” the team wrote. “Should this outcome occur, the immediate reaction could produce a double-digit one-day return for equities.” S&amp;P 500 up 10% to 12%
* 50 basis point hike and a hawkish press conference: An outcome that could stem from a Fed that is increasingly concerned about financial stabilities as it balances growth and inflation. S&amp;P 500 up 4% to 5%
* 75 basis point hike and a dovish press conference: A scenario viewed as having the second-highest probability of playing out. “If you saw the Fed give explicit guidance for the December meeting, then that is likely viewed as a dovish outcome.” S&amp;P 500 up 2.5% to 3%
* 75 basis point hike and a hawkish press conference: “This is the most likely outcome with Powell retaining optionality for December and 2023 meetings while emphasizing the current risks to inflation moving higher.” The team also views this as the outcome most expected by bond markets, so says there may not be a significant move in yields that keeps equities from melting down. S&amp;P 500 down 1% to up 0.5%
* 100 basis point hike and a dovish press conference: While this is seen as unlikely as a 50 basis point hike, it may mean the Fed both wants a higher terminal rate and wants to complete the tightening cycle this year. “Separately, the market may digest this move as the Fed having prior knowledge of where next week’s CPI prints.” S&amp;P 500 down 4% to 5%
* 100 basis point hike and a hawkish press conference: Considered the best outcome for equity bears waiting for this latest rally to dissipate. “Here this would seem to be a Fed reassessing its own inflation forecasts, which some investors feel is too optimistic.” S&amp;P falls 6% to 8%, likely resting year-to-date lows.

It is nothing more than that, and yet it represents a great deal more. 

It is a piece of paper that vitally affects you and us and the entire financial community. It is also a piece of paper that despite being old and encrusted with a century or more of hoary legalisms has the most amazing, the most appalling reproductive capacity -- it procreates not merely subdivisions of itself but during the course of its life and travels generates an incredible number of relative pieces of paper, that cling to it, describe it, give it directions, authenticate it, transfer it, transform it, cancel it, encumber it. Like all relatives, these attachments are each very different and together very expensive.

The progenitor piece of paper to which I am referring, of course, is the stock certificate.""

A lengthy read, that I'm too lazy to type it all out. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1971/020871smith.pdf)

Why did I come across this, some might ask? 

Well, I was trying to find out when stock market became electronic. Then I was wondering who programmed it.. 

Okay then, why am I curious about who programmed it?

I'm kindly regarded, hugely. But I still wonder things sometimes; If some of you are like me, and have been glued to these charts past 2'ish years - there's a kind of relative thing happening.. I can't quite describe it but as a uh, prolonged barrel-rolling sewing machine pattern, if that makes sense... and it's not 'making' something it's .. well, sort of seeding a landscape we're looking at from top-down..

Which got me to the wondering part, who was it that programmed the NASDAQ initially? 

6oo6ling that specific Q got me nothing so I broke down what I could possibly render a reasonable direction from: computer/software companies in the 60's

A few things stood out to me - IBM, Fortran, and [Harlan Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills) 

IBM because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then. 

"" In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than [4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1946%E2%80%931959:_Postwar_recovery,_rise_of_business_computing,_space_exploration,_the_Cold_War) were IBM machines. ""

&amp;#x200B;

[Fortran](https://emmachev.com/what-is-the-difference-between-pascal-and-fortran-programming-languages/) because it is a procedural, imperative, general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations. After IBM developed it in the 1950s, it soon gained popularity in programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then Harlan Mills. Just look at his timelines and titles. Specifically -  

* Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1975–81

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my thinking.. SEC knew then what we know now. Banks are assholes doing asshole stuff (if you read more of ""A Piece of Paper Revisted"" (see way above). And they figured, well, if we get rid of the human element (to some degree) this might make things more legit for more ppl than less of them. 

IBM is a huge, American computer company. Invest in America, it was the 50's/60's afterall. We were boomin' baby. And they have this Fortran language that handles all kinds of processes. Then we have Harlan Mills - I mean for all what was going on above... he has a suspiciously obvious time gap.. then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth.. pretty sus cuh.

&amp;#x200B;

All right, you've gotten this far in my rabbit hole. 

Along my tinfoil travels, I came across this other dude [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Early_years) \- he apparently influenced Harlan Mills - As an IBM research fellow, Mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development. These included automata theory, the structured programming theory of Edsger Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, and others, and Markov chain-driven software testing.

But what got me in Dijkstra's 'Legacy' section was the [Banker's alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) \- 

The Banker algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an ""s-state"" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

And this is when I came full circle on the part above I was trying to describe at ""I'm kindly regarded."" 

Anyway, this rabbit-hole kinda tripped me out. Figured a share.

Lets review the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November. 

What other macro trends do you think I missed? 

PS. if you don't want to short the market, short TSLA. Its the most obvious play out there.
