wallstreetbets	Guilty-Ham	self.wallstreetbets	21	‘Dramatic increase.’ Foreclosure filings are up more than 150%. Here’s what that tells us about the housing market	"The number of foreclosure starts — which is when the first public foreclosure notice happens — is up 219% since the start of the year, according to real estate data analytics firm ATTOM Data Solutions’ midyear 2022 U.S. foreclosure market report. What’s more, the number of properties that had foreclosure filings (this number includes foreclosure starts) is up 153% from the same time period last year. 

Fully 96% of major metro areas saw an annual increase in foreclosure filings, with foreclosure rates highest in Illinois, New Jersey and Ohio. And when it comes to the number of foreclosure starts, California topped the list, followed by Florida, Tennessee, Illinois and Ohio.

“Foreclosure activity across the United States continued its slow, steady climb back to pre-pandemic levels in the first half of 2022,” says Rick Sharga, executive vice president of market intelligence at ATTOM. “While overall foreclosure activity is still running significantly below historic averages, the dramatic increase in foreclosure starts suggests that we may be back to normal levels by sometime in early 2023,” says Sharga. (See the lowest mortgage rates you can get here.)
What does this uptick in foreclosures mean for the housing market?

Foreclosures are shooting up as the various foreclosure moratoriums that kept people in their homes during the worst of the pandemic’s economic disruptions have now ended, explains Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com. That said, they are shooting up from extremely low levels, she adds — noting that even after the sharp increase in foreclosure activity observed in the first half of 2022, we’re still not back to 2019’s low pre-pandemic mid-year total.

“Much like the sharp turnaround in housing inventory that we’ve observed in the number of for-sale homes recently, when the market has tilted in one direction very extremely, we see huge percentage increases when the trends shift back in a different direction, even though in many aspects what we’re witnessing is just a return to something resembling what was once normal,” says Hale.

Indeed, “it’s important to note that many of the foreclosure starts we’re seeing today — in fact, much of the overall foreclosure activity we’re seeing right now is on loans that were either already in foreclosure or were more than 120 days delinquent prior to the pandemic,” says Sharga. Indeed, many of these loans were protected by the foreclosure moratorium put in place by the government during the pandemic — therefore just halting the inevitable by a couple of years. Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate says, “Foreclosure activity is returning to normal levels after being artificially depressed by pandemic-induced payment relief programs and extended foreclosure moratoriums. In a historical context, foreclosures are still very low.”

And while these foreclosure numbers sound dramatic, Holden Lewis, home and mortgage expert at NerdWallet, says it’s not enough to make a dent in the housing market or the overall economy. “Even a healthy housing market has foreclosures, and this pace is nothing to worry about,” says Lewis.
What does this mean for buyers?

While foreclosures remain unfortunate for the owners of those homes, for shoppers who have been frustrated by the lack of homes for sale in their budget, the increase in foreclosures could bring additional options, says Hale. “But much like the increases we see in for-sale housing inventory, it’s just the first step. We would need to see many more months of these increases before home shoppers will feel like they have an abundance of homes to choose from,” says Hale. source without paywall: https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marketwatch.com%2Fpicks%2Fdramatic-increase-foreclosure-filings-are-up-more-than-150-heres-what-that-tells-us-about-the-housing-market-01659181360"	0.88	12	0	12	news	2022-11-03T10:01:19Z	ykvrzo	t3

wallstreetbets	High-Voltage-	self.wallstreetbets	9	Fed's meeting interpretations from the experts...	"
*  The next step might be 50 basis points.
* More hikes are coming.
* The terminal rate is going to be higher.
* Fed is trying to give investors hope by slowing of rate hike pace but not pivoting at the same time.
* It takes 9-12 months for rate hikes to be felt and 12-18 months for the maximum effect. It makes sense to slow down the current pace given we are only eight months past the first rate hike.
* Fed will want slower total and core inflation, pullbacks in house prices and rents, slower wage growth, lower job openings, and likely an increase in the unemployment rate prior to a real pivot.
* Fed is also concerned about the upcoming winter heating season that may cause another spike in energy prices.
* Rate hikes are likely to continue into 2023 in smaller increments.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%. (Stats as of 2022-10-28)"	0.75	8	0	8	dd	2022-11-03T04:30:07Z	ykpuun	t3

Does that mean earnings is likely going be bad?  As they could of announced this “somewhat” good news on earnings, but decided to issues the news a day prior to earnings.

The specific company I am talking about is Virgin Galactic SPCE.  Earnings is tomorrow and while they have no earnings the expectation is that their spaceship fleet is ready to fly.  However might get delayed.

Today they provided a update that they have found suppliers for their next generation fleet.

wallstreetbets	0x11C3P	self.wallstreetbets	16	Fed Talk + JPOW opinions	"I closed out my puts today for some modest gains. Listening through the meeting and listening it through it again, I do sense a bit dovishness in his speech. More so than I had originally anticipated looking at the underlying economic data. Caveat to that is it really involves one thing, the rate of increase, not overall Fed Fund rate increase. On the latter, it looks like he's taking that 25 bps and going to push it towards the Feb meeting. I'm overall still bearish for the time being. 

The rate hike that I initially anticipated would be 75 bps for December. It's looking highly more likely that'll it'll be 50 bps. That said, it's looking way more likely that Feb will be 50 bps increase as well in 2023 and will hold it there. That'll push it towards the 4.75%-5% range.

That said, if economic data doesn't improve halfway through this month going past December, I'm thinking they'll keep pushing rates into Q2 2023 most likely in 25 bps range pushing it over the 5% Fed fund rate point. 

Plan your strategies accordingly and expect a bumpy ride. This latest messaging was less clear with mixed economic data coming. 

TL;DR: Swing trade until mid December data. Expect new bottoms to form some time over the next couple months and then hit capitulation in Q1 2023. Will most likely go sideways for most of 2023 with solid recovery going into Q4."	1	6	0	6	question	2022-11-03T00:07:26Z	ykj8cn	t3

Powell agreed there wil at some point be a time to slow rate… however, he confirmed that time is not now and it would be pre-mature… The question that will remain now is was this some unbelievably wild over reaction to what JPOW said or did we just witness the top get put in? There is a case to be made for both that’s for sure.

I took the 389C overnight and that was looking rough for a really long time this morning. Thankfully with the rogue pump before FOMC and then the 2pm pump that was expected I exited for a pretty decent win. Not the best exit but when its moving like that it’s the best you can do for sure. 

That pump also allowed me as expected to exit my now 5dte 386C too for almost 20% win.

I did follow my plan of the 234pm calls. I entered and hit 30% profits pretty much instantly… unfortunately that was where the music stopped playing for me. I fully expected based on movement that we were going to see a really big bullish break out on SPY after the 230 presser as historically has happened. However, it dumped pretty much immediately after I entered. I never saw green again and there was no sense to average down or try to do anything silly. 

If you were okay with small profits it did hit, however, if you weren’t fast it turned into a loss.

Someone asked me last night “why don’t you present a bearish case too?” well until today there wasn’t really a reason to present one. What do I mean by that? Well we had been holding this red bull channel for over 3 weeks now. There was little reason to bet against that until we saw like now a breakdown of that support. 

With SPY now breaking through that green channel support of 378.1 and not only that it also rejected the attempted break through of 388.6 resistance I do favor a bearish case now. With the blue resistance line and red bull channel support line there was also a rising wedge formed that has now broken. 

From here we look at our key levels which will be that 378.1 resistance level. If SPY can break back through there and close over that level tomorrow there actually could be a case made that today was some massive over reaction and we are going to see a reversion to mean break to the upside 385 range tomorrow. However, if we back test and reject 378.1 that is even more confirmation of downside to come. 

If you remember since last CPI the media was screaming a fed pivot and a fed slowing of rate hikes. Overall JPOW effectively just said that is NOT happening right now but in the future will happen. With that narrative now squashed where are we going to go next? The next thing on the Agenda is CPI on November 10th which so far we still do not have a consensus on core or CPI yet. However, monthly CPI is consensus of 0.7 which would be a 0.3% rise over previous MoM. I expect that CPI to release soon and I expect that could absolutely move the markets. 

Key support- 374.6 -&gt; 370.5 -&gt; 365

Key resistance- 378.1 -&gt; 379.9 -&gt; 384.1 -&gt; 388.6

Futures does not look any better then SPY and has broken through the red bull channel support also and landed at 3760 support. This will be the next support that bears what to try to take out. Bulls will look to get this back over 3865 by EOW if they want to remain bullish going forward. 

One major bearish thing we can take away here is that this week effectively was a daily 100ema rejection and now huge break down through daily 8 and 20ema. The bearish case is rising in strength. 

Key support- 3705 -&gt; 3675 -&gt; 3585

Key resistance- 3800 -&gt; 3865 -&gt; 3925

Apple actually was the last domino to fall today and even more interestingly about Apple it has officially broken through the bottom from Friday. That huge green day that Apple had on Friday is now completely gone and then some. 

With this bull channel now broken we are looking at downside obviously now too. It is hard to tell in this picture because if I zoomed out too far it would be hard to see the candles but we are actually seeing quite a bit of red. Looking at the daily you can see that 150.6 is the KEY pivot level of bullish vs. bearish and we are seeing a pretty aggressive rejection of the daily 100 and 200ema which I mentioned earlier would take a few trading days to play out. 

Key support- 144.7 -&gt; 141.1 -&gt; 138.2 

Key resistance- 149.2 -&gt; 150.6 -&gt; 153.4 -&gt; 155.4

They really did massacre my girl Tesla today. I was actually impressively bullish on tesla with that closure over key 230 and the candle body over the daily 20ema which fully closing over the daily 8ema. However, we just saw a pretty massive rejection of the daily 20ema today and closure just above key support at 214.9. 

Key support- 214.9 -&gt; 210 -&gt; 205.6

Key resistance- 219.4 -&gt; 225.8 -&gt; 229.9

What would a -2.5% red day on SPY be without the VIX closing barely green at 0.12%... Well I had imagined they were unwinding the VIX for FOMC and especially for CPI next week, however, I would have expected to see a reaction on the VIX especially with this dump. There is clearly still fear and unknown in this market thanks to JPOW today, however, the VIX didn’t really react. Will it react tomorrow? Or is this going to end up being a straight volume dump with VIX once again being detached? 

Daily log- 

Well I am going to start doing these a little differently! I am going to start a 2.5k 10% take profit/ 20% stop loss challenge. So EOD you will see me post my daily log and post results of a 2.55k challenge. I will probably end up making a separate post for the 2.5k challenge also. For me usually my first trade of the day is my best trade so I will utilize my first entry for the trade. I will use the full $2500 per trade (well as close as I can) and I will update this via Excel like my normal port. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1g4jz5ebqlx91.png?width=828&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05a2491de9d015a29655f9088fa96de3697abc0f

I will start the challenge tomorrow just going to move a few things around in my accounts. Now the thing with this is that it is NOT about full porting… that’s absolutely not what im doing this for and $5000 is not a full port for me. What I am doing instead is hoping to show you guys whether its $500, $1000, $2500, $10,000, etc. etc. If you have proper strategy and risk management and take small profits those small profits will add up over time. This is to show you compound growth. Yes one loss of 20% does set you back two 10% wins, but if you continue to trade the $2,500 it adds up and recovers fairly quickly. 

This is not a full port as I said… I will be utilizing $2,500 PER TRADE so as you see above the starting “balance” is $2,500 but that’s not all that is in there. In the future I may do another one of just one trade a day starting with like $5,000 or something in the account and attempt to grow that… the same premise remains though that as long as you maintain a good strategy one loss really only takes 2-3 trades to over come. With premiums being so ridiculous right now it’s a little hard to use less then $2,500 and even some days $2,500 will be a stretch but like I said it will be as close to $2,500 as it can be. 

I will continue to trade normally in my other account doing day traders/ scalps and of course my level to levels.

Not my best day but not my worse day. The important lesson today was no matter how highly probable a trade is… it can ALWAYS go against you and not only that… it is only a high probability trade if we remember to take profits. These trades that are the “big hitters” have to be lotto size and you have to understand that as you see above there is a chance it goes straight to zero.

wallstreetbets	Annual_Equipment_370	self.wallstreetbets	46	I'm pivoting	"Wow, I'm just gonna cash out, delete my brokerage app and forget about fucking stocks forever.  
This week I've accurately used my 3 pre-PDT trades to gain $500 and get rid of this status right before today's shitstorm. I was sitting in cash, 25.2k, just waiting for the FOMC, playing chess and thinking that I'm probably done for today unless market chooses a clear direction after the meeting. Then I see a notification on my phone. YOUR POSITION MAY BE LIQUIDATED.   


wat?  


I opened the app and saw that I'm fucking shorting SQQQ at 52.00 and it's 53.50 now. I forgot to cancel one of the stop orders and went short on margin. I freaked out, tried to cancel the trade via app support and set a buy order at 52.11. Eventually the position was closed at this price and I only lost like $50 on that. And a shitload on neurones.  


After I closed the position, I had a chat with my gf about all the situation, we freaked out, but I felt lucky to escape a potential infinite loss.   


So, happy end, huh? I've evaded PDT status by doing two good trades and dodged this short margin position liquidation.  


Well, after some time I saw a bunch of enormous green dicks on SQQQ chart, realised that market has decided to finally dump and I still can join the trend, bought some SQQQ at 56.00, with default stop loss at 55.00 and profit taker at 57.00. Right after my order was filled, the stonk started to tank. I felt stressed af. It was too much for today and just wanted to exit the trade, fuck off and chill till tomorrow. Instead of closing it with minimal loss, I just watched SQQQ dropped to 55, lost $500, received PDT status, then in half an hour SQQQ jumped to 58, and to 59 in another half an hour. So if I haven't initialised the trade, I would've been +$450 today. If I've sold at a $100 loss, I'd still be fine. If I've managed my stop loss according to volatility, I would've been + extra $1k at close.  


Instead, I'm banned from trading for 90 days. I just watch the market rapidly tanking, feel even more FOMO and self-hatred for being stupid enough to do some emotional trades after such a day and risking my 25k PDT limit. I can't deposit extra money to the account, because my Ukrainian bank doesn't allow me to send USD abroad due to war time restrictions.  


I was waiting for this fucking FOMC and upcoming 52w lows during this whole bullshit rally month, hoping to ride the SQQQ till SPY @ 360. Now I'm fucked, my plan is fucked, finances are fucked. Total loss: $5k. Not as devastating as some of you apes have, but painful enough, and I won't be able to manage this loss in the next 90 days, maybe never, I just feel sick from these fucking candles. Maybe I'll just buy virgin IVW in Feb and maybe will be able to cover my losses in 5 years with the help of cOmPoUnD iNtErEsT. If we won't die in fucking great nuclear war recession till then.  


What a life!

The next day (Thursday 09/22) spy had and up and down day. (closed around a $1 higher than We’d 09/21). Come Friday, 09/23, Spy dropped about $11, closing out the week at $367 ish.
If y’all believe this trend will continue, Expect spy to drop in the 360s by Friday with a bleak November month to follow

I bought right before the market pump and saw a big red stick on the SQQQ position.  
I held strong and had faith in JPOW.

Also, thanks to JPOW I was able to mitigate my losses on my ABNB FD 90 puts.  
I happily sold for only a 35% loss on those; but made 50% on my 100 P FD play (around 7K in profit).

Every day this week I keep buying an option, setting up the limit to what I believe to be a fairly low number (about 60% of what I bought the option for), and then a few hours later finding out the stock just gracefully kissed the limit I put in place before rocketing back up. Every. Single. Day. Today as soon as I saw the fed announcement I bought SQQQ calls for dirt cheap and set up a stop loss for half of what I bought them for. Recently I checked how the market was doing and was very happy to see I probably just doubled my money, only to find out that the option got ONE CENT past my stop loss, sold, and THEN doubled in value over the next 30 minutes.

# Final Comment

&amp;#x200B;

AMC is a heavily indebted company; the leverage is unsustainable, and the company is struggling to have positive net income. Its Cash Burning Rate is at 2.56, meaning its spending 2.5 times more its cash availability, giving the company a life expectancy of 30 moths with its current cash &amp; cash equivalents. It will need to cash in accounts receivables to extend more its life expectancy.

Income quality dropped drastically since 2018, it means that total earnings do not correspond to the actual cash intake from its operations.

Cash Ration indicate that the company will struggle to pay its current liabilities with its current cash.

Without  a drastic change in its fundamentals, the company is in high risk.

It is advisable to keep an eye on the Company operations and Management Action and evaluate possible adjustments for the final pricing without any changes in trends, the company is destined to die.

Can't a stock go up in inflation times and also in ""normal"" times, because companies can extract profit in many ways. In inflation companies get profit because they charge people more, in ""normal"" times companies get profit because more customer on average

FED may slow down the rate of increase. We will see 50 basis point increases instead of 75. But we ain't stopping any time soon. 


Long term forecast is more pessimistic than previously forecasted. 


IMO they will get interest rates close to core inflation and see how much it slows down inflation. Then they may increase it further for a full on recession to bring prices down by killing the economy. 


If core inflation does start going down through Q4 and early 2023, we will see slower rate increases. If stays high, we're going to 6% very fast. 


That's my 2 cents. Cheers regards."	0.75	12	0	12	question	2022-11-02T20:48:49Z	ykdff9	t3

wallstreetbets	predictany007	self.wallstreetbets	12	Fed approves 0.75-point hike to take rates to highest since 2008 and hints at change in policy ahead	"The Federal Reserve on Wednesday approved a fourth consecutive three-quarter point interest rate increase and signaled a potential change in how it will approach monetary policy to bring down inflation.

In a well-telegraphed move that markets had been expecting for weeks, the central bank raised its short-term borrowing rate by 0.75 percentage point to a target range of 3.75%-4%, the highest level since January 2008.

The move continued the most aggressive pace of monetary policy tightening since the early 1980s, the last time inflation ran this high.

Along with anticipating the rate hike, markets also had been looking for language indicating that this could be the last 0.75-point, or 75 basis point, move. Specifically, some Fed officials along with Wall Street economists and strategists in recent weeks had talked of a “step-down” in policy that could see a rate increase of half a point at the December meeting and then a few smaller hikes in 2023.

That language was not overt in the post-meeting statement from the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, though there was a tweak that could point to an adjustment in policy.

This week’s statement expanded on previous language simply declaring that “ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate.“

The new language read: “The Committee anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time.“

The statement reiterated that policy changes “will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.“

Markets will look to Chairman Jerome Powell’s news conference at 2:30 p.m. for more clarity on whether the Fed thinks it can implement less restrictive policy that would include a less dramatic level of rate hikes to achieve its inflation goals.

Along with the tweak in the statement, the FOMC again categorized growth in spending and production as “modest” and noted that “job gains have been robust in recent months” while inflation is “elevated.” The statement also reiterated language that the committee is “highly attentive to inflation risks.“

The rate increase comes as recent inflation readings show prices remain near 40-year highs. A historically tight jobs market in which there are nearly two openings for every unemployed worker is pushing up wages, a trend the Fed is seeking to head off as it tightens money supply.

Concerns are rising that the Fed, in its efforts to bring down the cost of living, also will pull the economy into recession. Powell has said he still sees a path to a “soft landing” in which there is not a severe contraction, but the U.S. economy this year has shown virtually no growth even as the full impact from the rate hikes has yet to kick in.

At the same time, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure showed the cost of living rose 6.2% in September from a year ago – 5.1% even excluding food and energy costs. GDP declined in both the first and second quarters, meeting a common definition of recession, though it rebounded to 2.6% in the third quarter largely because of an unusual rise in exports. At the same time, housing prices have plunged as 30-year mortgage rates have soared past 7% in recent days.

On Wall Street, markets have been rallying in anticipation that the Fed soon might start to ease back as worries grow over the longer-term impact of higher rates.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained more than 13% over the past month, in part because of an earnings season that wasn’t as bad as feared but also amid growing hopes for a recalibration of Fed policy. Treasury yields also have come off their highest levels since the early days of the financial crisis, though they remain elevated. The benchmark 10-year note most recently was around 4.04%.

There is little if any expectation that the rate hikes will halt anytime soon, so the anticipation is just on a slower pace. Futures traders are pricing a near coin-flip chance of a half-point increase in December, against another three-quarter point move.

Current market pricing also indicates the fed funds rate will top out near 5% before the rate hikes cease.

The fed funds rate sets the level that banks charge each other for overnight loans, but spills over into multiple other consumer debt instruments such as adjustable-rate mortgages, auto loans and credit cards.

wallstreetbets	Flat-Diver3372	self.wallstreetbets	44	Unpopular opinion, Meta is undervalued.	I think the current stock development regarding Meta is a result of people expecting a fully optimal and working product way before its deadline. Listen, Zuck MIGHT be an absolute regard and Meta MIGHT be the downfall of his company, but I hardly believe that’s the case. Take VR-chat for example, I have seen lots of people compare meta with vr-chat pointing out that there already is an existing product that currently, beats meta in regards to graphics and so on. But meta was and isnt meant to be like vr-chat. Vr-chat didnt change gaming or gaming trends in basically any shape or form. We still use our systems and most of us would never switch to vr when we have pc and other standard gaming consoles. So why would meta try to create an already existing product, which has proven to not be very successfull? Well I think the answer is simple, they’re not doing that. The massive spending everyone is constantly reffering to is obviously not spent on the graphics or how it ”looks”, but the engine and the software, that currently (as shown by vr-chat), is very underdeveloped. The product isnt and was never meant to be operational or used right now, but everyone seems to think that because of the massive spending, bad graphics and an unfinished product, meta is DOOMED. I believe that there is profound potential in the metaverse because of the massive spendings, not the other way around. People want groundbreaking technology that potentially could represent reality, but act suprised when it turns out the cost of such a system to be built, is massive. Regarded sheep mindset.

Analysts polled by Capital IQ, on average, had been expecting the oil and natural gas producer to earn $2.13 per share during the three months ended Sept. 30.

Total revenue was $5.43 billion, up from $3.47 billion in the year earlier. The Street was looking for $4.81 billion.

wallstreetbets	Humble-Warthog8302	self.wallstreetbets	12	Why we are not in restrictive territory, and rates will continue to go higher.	"You often hear about jpow needing to get to restrictive rates. What does that really mean? 

Rates in have to be above the rate of inflation. 

For example, if you get a mortgage at current rates, about 7% and the rate of inflation is at 8.1%, you are borrowing money at a rate that is lower than inflation, which is not considered restrictive, or that it is stiil cheaper to borrow vs the appreciation of a commodity or asset.

The dilemma that jpow faces, is the time lag theory, which states that for each rate hike, it takes at minimum 6 months for for it to effect in the economy. The totality of  the effects of the rate hikes will really not be known until mid 2023. So no one really knows what the actual effects of hikes will do.

1.) Core CPI is still high and inflation seems to be sticky

2.) Unemployment in the U.S. is pretty low

3.) Risk assets have rallied during the last weeks

This three reasons gives the Fed the right to stay hawkish IMO. I think the Dollar will rally at 2:00pm (except the rate hike is only 50bps) and it might be only a bart pattern again, like at the last one in September.

wallstreetbets	ismokenct	self.wallstreetbets	73	Why do people buy Apple so much?	"I'm talking about Apple PRODUCTS

&amp;#x200B;

All apple products are pricey things, including the iPhone, mac, iPad and everything.

Yes they are excellent products with absolutely outstanding performances compared to other products out in the market. Still, yet a LOT of people who buy apple products can save a fortune by picking other products other than the standard MacBook or the iPhone. But yet they have so much market monopoly going on all over the world with such products that will normally be considered quite expensive, to the extent this is almost baffling

&amp;#x200B;

Apple grew AGAIN in the latest quarter
(While all the other major companies mostly had an earnings shock) and I personally think this can only be explained by ""People paying for apple products again and again."" If apple was a growing company aspiring to eat up a lot of the marketplace in the future then the reason for their growth would be pretty obvious. But they're not. It's not like they're starting to insert ads within the ios to increase their revenue. Their one and only source of profit is (mostly) their Apple products. Phones, Laptops, and Tablets that are more than outstanding in quality but also have a significantly higher price tag compared to other products.

It's making people buy the same iPhone again and more (well, not the same but you can still work longer with your previous iPhone.). I don't think Apple would be able to grow this much if people only bought a single iPhone to replace their previous iPhone every three years when their iPhone finally dies.  For some reason they're making the same people buy so much apple products again although their extremely high price tag. Something like buying another iPhone in a shorter span. Or buying other Apple products as well after purchasing your iPhone. Adding a new Macbook in your shopping cart although your previous one is still good.

Seems like people LOVE the iPhone. Yes it's a cult, it's almost something like a new religion

&amp;#x200B;

They don't really have a lot of new customers out there to purchase their first iPhone. Yet the company is still GROWING. A LOT

&amp;#x200B;

Is it the marketing? Is it because of product quality?

&amp;#x200B;

How is the company still GROWING?

&amp;#x200B;

or am i missing something?

wallstreetbets	predictany007	self.wallstreetbets	16	Amazon has exited the trillion-dollar club. Sell-off pushes market cap below $1 trillion for first time since April 2020	" 

* Amazon’s stock closed down Tuesday for a fifth straight day, falling to the lowest since April 2020.
* Last week the company projected sales in the holiday quarter would be far below expectations.
* The stock dropped 5.9% to $96.79.
* Amazon has exited the trillion-dollar club.

Shares of the e-retailer plunged 5.9% on Tuesday, falling for a fifth straight day and closing at their lowest since April 2020. The sell-off has erased almost all of the stock’s pandemic surge.

Investors continued to punish the company for last week’s disappointing fourth-quarter forecast. Amazon said revenue during the holiday quarter would grow 2% to 8% over the year-ago period, far below analysts’ estimates. The cloud division, Amazon Web Services, also reported weaker-than-expected sales.

It’s the first time Amazon’s market cap has been below $1 trillion since April 2020. The stock has plunged 42% in 2022 and is on pace for its worst year since 2008, when it dropped 45%. The only other year that was worse was during the dot-com crash of 2000, when the company lost 80% of its value.

Like the rest of Big Tech, Amazon has struggled this year due to a slumping economy, soaring inflation and rising interest rates. On top of that, Amazon has been forced to scale back after expanding dramatically during the pandemic, now that consumers have returned to stores.

Amazon has been the second-worst performer in the Big Tech group this year, behind Facebook parent Meta, which has plummeted 72%. Meta told investors last week that revenue in the fourth quarter would likely decline for a third straight period.

Captivating **TL;DR** today - **number go up.** Purchases are u**p 345% ($4.9M to $22M)** from the prior week along with sales, which increased +290% ($263M to $1B). The bulk of purchases stems from insiders at Mobileye Global Inc within the IT sector / Electronic Equipment industry. Active insiders and companies are up 18% and 25% respectively from the prior week.

# High-Level Stats:

* Purchases increased from $4.9M to $22M (+345%)
* Sales increased from $263.5M to $1.02B (+290%)
* Transactions increased from 267 to 316 (+18%)
* Companies represented in Form 4s increased from 170 to 200 (+18%)
   * Net buyers increased from 14 to 23 (+64%)
   * Net sellers increased from 156 to 177 (+13%)
* Insiders filing Form 4s increased from 234 to 292 (+25%)
   * Net buyers increased from 25 to 38 (52%)
   * Net sellers increased from 209 to 254 (+22%)

# Transaction Selection

1. **All** **Direct Open Market Transactions** from **October 24th - October 28th.** These are Form 4 filings with a Transaction Code of “P” or “S”. This narrows the scope to trades where insiders are putting their money on the line.
2. Weekly comparisons are to transactions from **October 17th - October 21st.**
3. **No companies without a ticker** (e.g. opportunity/income/mutual funds).

# Further Context

1. Form 4 data is impacted by a concept known as **backfill** which is par for the course with transactional data. The delay between the Filing Date and the Transaction Date is **\*roughly\*** 2 days and your mileage will vary. This means that **more transactions for past dates can arrive in future filings.** That is why looking at larger trends is key.
2. To combat backfill, filings through this Tuesday are included **\*if\*** the transaction date is from the prior week. Otherwise, transactions from this week are excluded.
3. Data is sourced by the algorithms behind [Form Fore](http://formfore.io/)

# Feedback/Updates

* All feedback, **good bad, and ugly** are welcome - aiming to make these as helpful as possible.
* The **public workbook** should be ready for initial release **sometime next week**. Will also share on Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/FormFore) if that is your preferred hub.
* The newsletter is likely a few weeks out and on my radar. I appreciate your patience!

wallstreetbets	Fuego1050	self.wallstreetbets	5	AMERICAN Cannabis Companies could follow Canopy’s Structure to Up-List on the Toronto Stock Exchange - Third Largest in World - MSOS ETF	"https://mjbizdaily.com/could-american-marijuana-companies-follow-canopy-growth-to-toronto-stock-exchange/

(TRULIEVE, VERANO, GREENTHUMB, CRESCO, CURALEAF) 

Ontario, Canada-based licensed cannabis producer Canopy Growth’s plans to launch Canopy USA to accelerate its acquisitions of three American marijuana companies and remain listed on a major stock exchange might have provided a blueprint for U.S. companies.

American cannabis operators who touch the plant could follow the Canopy road map to uplist from the Canadian Securities Exchange to the Toronto Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq – provided they’re willing to do a major restructuring, experts told MJBizDaily.

The upside to listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), North America’s third-largest exchange, is that it could help cannabis companies attract more institutional investment.

So far, American plant-touching cannabis companies – such as multistate operators – haven’t been able to raise capital on major exchanges because of the federal illegality of cannabis in the U.S., opting instead to list on the Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE) and over-the-counter markets.

And that might still be a problem, at least for the Nasdaq, which expressed objections to Canopy’s plans and could delist the Smiths Falls-based company.

But the TSX has been more receptive, which could provide U.S. plant-touching operators an avenue for uplisting without waiting for the federal government to legalize marijuana or implement other major cannabis reforms.

In an email to MJBizDaily, Catherine Kee, spokesperson at TSX parent TMX Group, confirmed that Canopy worked directly with the exchange and shared its plans in advance of the announcement.

Kee declined to comment on whether U.S. companies could follow.

“We are aware that legislation applicable to the marijuana sector is evolving,” Kee said. “TMX continues to monitor the developments with interest and we remain committed to supporting the enduring success of the cannabis industry.”

In a note, equity analyst Owen Bennett of New York-based investment bank Jefferies Group wrote that the Toronto Stock Exchange’s approval of a Canopy listing could have major implications for U.S. operators through more M&amp;A by Canadian acquirers and/or enabling “U.S. (operators) to adopt the same structure and uplist to the TSX.”

Restructuring ‘gymnastics’
Kelly Fair – a partner with the international law firm Dentons and external counsel to Canopy’s new holding company Canopy USA – told MJBizDaily she’s proud of the creative approach she and the Canopy team have taken to accelerate U.S. market exposure.

Canopy USA will have a ring-fenced structure in which Canopy Growth would hold nonvoting, exchangeable shares in the holding company, segregating those U.S. assets from the rest of the company.


“To the extent that the substructure is embraced by at least the TSX, then that would provide the opportunity to the U.S. (multistate operators to uplist) potentially sooner than a full legalization event – if they wanted to go through the gymnastics to do structuring like this,” Fair said.

Any MSO looking to uplist would have to create a ring-fenced structure between the listed company and the company that’s actually touching the plant or holding the plant-touching entities, she said.

The pros and cons

Matt Karnes, founder of Greenwave Advisors, told MJBizDaily via email that the TSX is more expensive to list on than the CSE, but that it has more liquidity and more stringent listing requirements – which are both more appealing to institutional investors.

He also said Canopy could try to use TSX approval to pressure the Nasdaq to allow U.S. plant-touching businesses to list.

Another hitch, however, is whether Canopy’s auditors will sign off on consolidated financials that include plant-touching operations in the U.S.

“The Big 4 (accounting firms) have not engaged in U.S. cannabis thus far and this could signal a willingness to accept U.S. cannabis clients – a positive for U.S. cannabis as it gives added assurance to institutional investors as to the industry’s legitimacy,” he said.

Whatever happens, Karnes  believes U.S. multistate operators will follow Canopy’s lead, particularly if they don’t want to wait for legislation such as the Safe and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act that could pass during this lame-duck session of Congress.

“I think whatever path Canopy Growth USA takes, the MSOs will follow, and they don’t necessarily have to wait to see what happens with SAFE.”

wallstreetbets	Suspicious-Word-9514	self.wallstreetbets	19	Macroscope | The Fed meeting preview: 4th 75bps rate-hike is on the way, is pivot coming next?	"The Fed's two-day November meeting will end on Wednesday, and the market has well expected its fourth consecutive aggressive 75 basis point rate hike, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. The probability of a 75 basis point rate hike has reached as high as 85.5%, which would raise the federal funds rate to a range of 3.75%-4%, the highest level since 2008.

However, given the recent signals released by the Fed to slow down interest rate hikes, the market is likely to be more concerned about further signals from the Fed after the rate meeting on plans for a December rate hike and the direction of monetary policy next year. The Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has been vocal about the need to slow the pace of interest rate hikes at some point since July, and analysts believe he may also reiterate that point at this meeting. Additionally, a report by the ""New Fed Wire"" last week about the possibility of a slowdown in the Fed's aggressive policy in December continued to gather steam, with medium and long-term US bond yields topping out after hitting yearly highs.

Bloomberg economists said what is less certain is how Powell will communicate a potential future downshift in the rate-hike pace -- the degree of conviction, the risks around hike sizing, and implications for the terminal rate. Economists expect Powell to use 50 basis points present a 50-basis-point move as the base case and clarify that a downshift in the pace of rate hikes does not necessarily mean a lower terminal rate.

It is worth noting that the Fed’s November meeting is also just less than a week before the US mid-term elections. Undoubtedly, how to deal with the Republicans on the high-rise inflation and the risk of recession will become a major problem for Biden. And just last week, two Democratic senators urged Powell not to cause unnecessary pain by over-raising interest rates.

It has been said that there are now major divergences within the Fed on monetary policy. For example, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daley thinks the Fed should start discussions on slowing down rate hikes to avoid sending the economy into an ""unforced slump"". But Kansas Fed President Esther George believes that monetary policy needs to move into a restrictive range, and the strength remains to be watched. Given the recent volatility in the financial markets and the time it takes for interest rate hikes to affect the economy, the Fed cannot act too hastily.

There are also a few views that do not favour a pivot. Fed governor Michelle Bowman hopes to look for signs of falling inflation before slowing down the rate hike. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said he hopes to raise the policy rate to a level that would put meaningful downward pressure on inflation.

Therefore, for this meeting, FOMC members are expected to engage in a heated debate on how to steer interest rates to avoid a troubled economy.

“They may want to go slower just in the interest of financial stability,” said Julia Coronado, the founder of MacroPolicy Perspectives LLC. “It’s a challenge for messaging because they don’t want to ease financial conditions significantly. They need tight financial conditions to keep cooling the economy off. So he (Powell) doesn’t want to sound dovish, but he may want to go slower.”

Some institutions took a relatively cautious view. Nomura believes that the FOMC does not yet seem to have a consensus on the preferred size of a December rate hike, which will limit Powell's ability to provide guidance. The Fed chairman will reiterate that future policy will depend on economic data, including the two non-farm payrolls reports and, most importantly, the latest inflation data. Barclays also released a report saying that the Fed may leave its December policy options open, pending more information on inflation and tightening risks.

The [J.P. Morgan](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NYSE-JPM/) team, on the other hand, made relatively “accurate “predictions on the outcome of this meeting. Analysts believe the most likely scenario going to happen is a 75 basis point rate hike and a hawkish press release, which could allow Powell to retain selectivity for December and next year meetings, while highlighting the current risks of higher inflation. In this scenario, S&amp;P 500 may float between down 1% to up 0.5%. And if the Fed provides clear guidance for the December meeting, this is likely to be seen as dovish and S&amp;P 500 could rise by 2.5%-3%.

In addition, former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers also tweeted recently, saying that the “growing chorus” for the Fed to pause interest rate hikes very soon is “badly misguided.” In his view, the Fed should stick to its current course and not pause too soon, especially given that it has a history of “past errors”.

Aside from rate hikes, let's not forget the glooming recession hanging over the US. Concerns were fuelled last week by the inversion in the 3-month/10-year US bond yields. Prior to this, the 2/10-year US bond inversion had been going on for almost five months. Given the historically extremely high success rate of both yield curves in predicting crisis, there is growing concern about how the Federal Reserve will respond to outside concerns about the economy.

Notably, Jerome Powell had said in the press conference after the September meeting that the goal of fighting inflation had not changed and would be maintained until the task completed, and the federal funds rate would need to be kept at a restrictive level for a certain time. But the FOMC had already revised down the US economic growth rate to 0.2% this year.

It is worth noting that while consumers, the engine of the US economy, are still maintaining spending in the face of inflationary pressures, danger signals are beginning to reveal. The US Department of Commerce said last week that consumer spending growth slowed to a near two-year low of 1.4% from 2.0% in the previous quarter, and consumer purchasing power continues to retreat at a 3% rate and US families are gradually running out of federal financial subsidies in the COVID pandemic."	0.75	10	0	10	question	2022-11-02T14:27:47Z	yk3wmu	t3

wallstreetbets	asmit10	self.wallstreetbets	4	$CCJ - Uranium Miner trying to break out of a 8 year downtrend	"$CCJ

Camerco claims:

Uranium inventories are low

Secondary supply is low

Nobody has been investing in supply

‘never started a cycle with this high of a uranium price’

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Camerco appears to be a good steward of capital and understands the market dynamics involved with being a supplier of a not-so-rare mineral

Camerco had \~10% of world uranium production in 2021

China adding \~150 nuclear power plants by 2035

China’s nuclear power generation in the past 10 years has been so great - that it has made up for Europe’s staunch stance on decommissioning - leading to the largest nuclear power plant power generation of all time in 2021. It is conceivable that the west is beginning to realize their mistake and are beginning the process of fixing it, out of necessity from Russia’s and Saudi Arabia’s oil cartel.

Yes, oil manufacturing is going to spike. Oil supply will eventually outpace demand, the Russian war will end, and energy prices will stabilize…but with China investing so much into low-cost energy, will the west want to remain dependent on Russia for economic stability?

Even the most anti-nuclear governments are temporarily halting their decision to decommission 30 year old plants

200 - 400 nuclear power plants to be decommissioned by 2040

Camerco recently announced a deal to buy Westinghouse..

…and Poland just announced they’re building their first nuclear power plant and chose the U.S. and Westinghouse to build their first Nuclear Power Plant.

According to [World-nuclear.org](https://World-nuclear.org): 

About 90 power reactors with a total gross capacity of about 90,000 MWe are on order or planned, and over 300 more are proposed. Most reactors currently planned are in Asia, with fast-growing economies and rapidly-rising electricity demand.

&amp;#x200B;

Major uranium miners are seeing a demand increase in Uranium out to 2024 - and are subsequently significantly increasing production, including Camerco

Many western governments have started initiatives to support nuclear initiatives

Last quarter financial results showed negative earnings because they wrote off the expanse of restarting a mine. They previously shut the mine off due to poor uranium market performance.

Their main competitor is also increasing uranium production. They are both doing so based on contracts they’ve obtained and plan to obtain - neither seem to participate in the spot market in a material way.

&amp;#x200B;

Technically speaking, $CCJ has begun trying to break out of a major downtrend going back to 2014.

$CCJ Reiterated multiple times that they see strong profit going forward, and see production along with spot rates increasing. Given this, the Russian - Saudi oil regime, China's emergence as the nuclear energy super power, a massive reversal in short-term power plant decomissioning, the global incentive to go nuclear (Low long term cost, removal of complete reliance on oil, 'going green'), and  the material fact that Western governments have begun to spend money supporting this thesis...

&amp;#x200B;

Do you guys have any thoughts?

&amp;#x200B;

I'll leave with a headline I found:

Article dated: 6 Oct 2022

# No nuclear power ‘renaissance’ as Europe wrestles energy crisis

""...But after eight months of fighting in Ukraine, and an energy crisis compounded most recently by the alleged sabotage of the arterial Nord Stream 1 and 2 Russia-to-Europe pipelines in the Baltic Sea, European governments long opposed to nuclear power have shown only incremental shifts in their attitudes, which have been informed by years of concerns about nuclear waste and safety.

&amp;#x200B;

A wider pivot has remained absent.

&amp;#x200B;

“We’re not talking about a nuclear renaissance, as such,” Nicolas Berghmans, an energy and climate expert at the France-based Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations (IDDRI), told Al Jazeera, “but maybe more of a change of tide.”

&amp;#x200B;

“A real nuclear renaissance would be if Europe decides to invest in more nuclear power plants.”"""	0.7	5	0	5	dd	2022-11-02T10:50:05Z	yjzuta	t3

Just a quick edit: [M2 Money Stock over the last 60 years](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL)

u/Infamous_Sympathy_91 's [post on credit card debt and personal savings from earlier today](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yjowp1/us_personal_savings_near_historic_lows/)


In 2020 money stopped moving. I wrote this in some of my previous posts and comments. In order to prop up economic activity, central banks increased money supply with almost 0 interest a.k.a Brrrrrr.

So ideally fresh minted money is distributed in the real economy and moves up and trickles down and so forth. As you can see in the chart above, money hasn't been moving as much in the economy since the peak in 2000; It's in constant decline with a hard fall in 2020.

Today central banks are trying to battle inflation. As you can see in the chart above, money isn't moving as much, so it's not that there is too much money in the real economy. Whatever they printed in the last 2 years went up to the big black void of finance. All the derivatives market, swaps, trenches and all sorts of made up bullshit has sucked up money faster than your wife sucking her boyfriend's cock.

Inflation is a product of price gauging and artificial crises, such as cutting down oil production, slowing down logistics around the globe, lagging or harsh response to the pandemic by governments etc.

What you're seeing with the interest rate increases will only hit small businesses and working people. Casino always wins. Banks will own everything. You will own nothing at the end of this.

In the next two years, you will lose your jobs, you will lose your homes if you have debt. You will start selling your assets until capitalism owns your ass. We had reached a point of multi-generational wealth with too many high net worth individuals. Those who are pulling the strings are actively sabotaging the economy and are robbing you.

The interest rates will once again go down, when most people lose everything and you can't borrow anymore. This isn't about bringing the inflation down by decreasing money spent in real economy. The chart in the link clearly shows you that there is no increased activity which would increase velocity of money.

So tomorrow or in the next year don't get your hopes up too much. Your average working class ape is in more debt than before and savings are at an all time low. The latest surge in house prices also guaranteed that banks and through them the central banks owns you.

This is the final stage of capitalism. Good luck to you all.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%. (Stats as of 2022-10-28)"	0.8	12	0	12	dd	2022-11-02T03:10:54Z	yjr9oh	t3

So you like to make money fast? Is your motto Lambo or food stamps? This it’s for you. At 2 PM ET FOMC announcement made. A large price movement occurs at this time , this movement creates a fair gap value , as Powell starts to speak at 2:30 ET a counter move starts to test price movement created at release of hike announcement occurs. This can easily 2x-4x your 0 dte SPY option if it goes well if it doesn’t you lose 100% of your initial gamble I mean investment. This same pattern has occurred for the last two years . It doesn’t guarantee that it will happen again. Risky scalp with large potential for profit/losses. Just to reiterate if price has a large move up at 2 pm ET than just before 2:30 ET buy puts, if price has a large move down at 2 pm ET than just before 2:30 ET buy calls . This strategy has become rather popular in discord channels/twitter. No positions at the moment as strategy needs to be executed at FOMC."	0.67	3	0	3	dd	2022-11-02T01:46:07Z	yjpc8o	t3

I would consider myself as an intermediate trader. I've been in game the game for some time and I want to learn something new that will make me a better trader. I dont need a book that is just a glorified dictionary. I am looking for something that looks at small details and also explain cutting edge info that the top wall street guys know. I've read a few good books on technical analysis namely:

**John J Murphy : Technical Analysis Of The Financial Markets**

**Abe Confas: The Forex trading course \_ a self-study guide to becoming a successful currency trader**

These two books were good at my level because the people writing them were well established in the trading industry and were writing from experience. Im not looking for ""FX trading for dummies"" or ""Technical analysis for dummies"" because these books are of very poor quality in terms of usefulness.

wallstreetbets	DaddyDersch	self.wallstreetbets	48	11-1-22 SPY/ ES Futures, Apple and Tesla Daily TA	"It was the night before FOMC and all through the markets there was oddities… I had mentioned last night actually in my TA that I expect at some point markets were going to get shocked by a big drop intraday instead of this recovery rip… that day was today. 

The interesting thing about today is that VOLD (volume) actually came in bullish at open and through the whole day pretty much until right before power hour VOLD was actually in extreme bull momentum. Now SPY could not break out and break away from 385 level. The thoughts are we either watched markets be held up by volume or there was just some weird stuff going on today. There was some dark pool prints hitting the tapes again today. 

The other interesting thing that I noted today is that this is the first time that the day before FOMC the VIX has been red (and especially didn’t spike) since the June FOMCs. The last two FOMCs were the first with a spike of the VIX the day before. 

What does that mean ? well im not quite sure but those months of FOMC were more bullish. 

&amp;#x200B;

We also have quite a few articles released today saying that Biden supports a pivot of the fed (this was later slightly walked back though). 

My initial thoughts on what to expect tomorrow is that JPOW drops a 75bps (I would be SHOCKED to see a 50bps) but then he should hint at a “we will remain data dependent but there is a case to slow hikes if we continue to see optimism and to fully evaluate the effects of rate hikes.” 

But tomorrow will be interesting to say the least!

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ig9cg0t6hex91.png?width=773&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=358cc3b9af8b4e8c28541c1fa6b63f0f176b3cad

This TA is going to be pretty brief as markets gonna move however the algos want it to with FOMC. 

But overall we did attempt to breakout over 390.1 resistance of the green channel. With that pretty stout rejection we are not finding support which we did find almost all day at 385. This could if we get a green day tomorrow also be seen as a nice daily 8ema/ 50ema support test. In addition I am seeing that the 8ema is crossing back over the 50ema (bullishly) for the first time in two months. 

The rejection at 390.1 also was a rejection of the daily 100ema which im not super surprised by as this level is usually a bigger fight. Markets will need the push from good FOMC news tomorrow to break through these key levels and breakout until CPI. 

Key support- 380.1 -&gt; 377.8 -&gt; 374.1

Key resistance- 388.6 -&gt; 390.1 -&gt; 393 -&gt; 397.8 (my potential target for a bullish FOMC)

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9bgssm97hex91.png?width=805&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9783ca967b5792443220149d07832cbaa52a8ad0

Looking at futures we have actually had this pattern play out just last week where we found support and managed to push up for an extreme green day. 

With a rejection of that 200ema today and that 3925 level that will remain key resistance and we will look for that level to be closed over tomorrow to continue to be bullish. 

Key support- 3845 -&gt; 3800

Key resistance- 3885 -&gt; 3925 -&gt; 3975

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ltoxlwp7hex91.png?width=817&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f44fae635aa9d27ab372a746783576c62c3174a7

Apple has nearly retraced all the way back to where it was Friday before that massive rip on earnings. I wish I woulda been smart enough to short it Friday at market close. Apple was able to back test and hold the daily 8/50ema support lines today, however fell and closed under the 100/200ema. 

Key support- 148 -&gt; 146

Key resistance- 153.4 -&gt; 155.7 -&gt; 157.4

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qukjw768hex91.png?width=819&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a75ef94a7d5cc178d7048d2b06400ce3d4f11994

Tesla actually had a pretty nice pop today and broke through (but failed to close over) a key level. I was mentioning as you can see that 205 to 230 red channel on tesla. With this break through I am actually looking at an upside move on tesla (despite FOMC). 

This is its first time its broken through key 230 resistance since October 7th. We still have not closed over 230 though but as long as tesla holds over its daily 8ema and continues to hold this red bull channel I will remain bullish on it. 

Key support- 230 -&gt; 224.8 -&gt; 219.2

Key resistance- 234.2 -&gt; 239.6

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mmpr6qc9hex91.png?width=503&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58c636921894dc187d9689ff9e4c84edfd019809

As I had mentioned this is the first FOMC since June that the VIX has not popped significantly the day before. To me this means markets are bullish. I think that anything super hawkish for the FOMC tomorrow especially if he says 75bps in December the VIX is going to spike like no other and we could very well end up with a huge red day. However, I remain bullish and I think JPOW wont say anything to tip the markets down tomorrow. 

10% challenge-

Overall today was yet again another untradeable day after the first big move. Was able to get some nice scalps in today. And with an average down on my SPY and Tesla puts this morning at open I was able to close the SPY level to level puts for green and close the Tesla level to level puts for a smaller loss (they were very red at open). I don’t like DCAing to win a play like that but I didn’t expect that massive pre-market and with SPY holding under and beginning to dump off the key 390.1 resistance at open I felt confident in the DCA.

TLDR for my fellow apes:

\- A scientist started mapping multiple countries' claimed economic growth numbers to the increase in city lights seen from satellites

\- He found a high correlation between the two in democratic countries that had a free press and independent parties measuring the numbers

\- He found a large discrepancy between the two in autocratic regimes that controlled the reporting agencies and the press (shocker!)

\- Tested his theory against reasons why totalitarian countries might have fewer lights when experiencing massive economic growth (hey! they like working and living in the dark! They're allergic to electricity! They care more about the environment!). Nothing seemed to stand up to scrutiny.

\- Based on the growth in lights, he estimates that China's growth was less than half what they claimed. This means that China's GDP is likely less than half of the US rather than nearly equal

\- The other side of the coin is that their total debt levels might be between 600-700% of GDP rather than 300%

\- Paper has been peer-reviewed and presented at multiple economic conferences

I know it's pretty mind-blowing to think China might actually lie about something like this given their honest and transparent dealings to date but you have to admit the science is pretty spiffy."	0.87	397	0	397	news	2022-11-01T22:09:25Z	yjjsm5	t3

wallstreetbets	KoGamer01	self.wallstreetbets	21	Fed Pivot? How I'm Playing it.	" 

TLDR- we could go higher but we have more uncertainty in the near future as opposed to the last 2 weeks.

Some important dates to keep in mind:

Nov. 2nd- FOMC day

Nov. 10th- Oct. CPI data

Cant post the chart cus VisualMod keeps on taking it down.

Simple as seeing the last bear market rally and then applying it to now. We saw a rising wedge form on the monthly chart which is happening now. If the fed says it will indeed be ""kinder and gentler"" in any way shape or form you better bet your bottom dollar we will go to 408. However, on the off chance, the Fed says it will continue to bring more pain all your calls will be worthless in a few days. Now keep in mind that Oct. CPI will also determine if we continue to keep going higher even after a Fed ""pivot"". If CPI comes in hot we could see a similar drop back down to 350.

My plan- Wait till FOMC to see if the fed is indeed going to be kinder and gentler. If so buy $400 calls then take out my initial before CPI and if CPI is hot buy $360 puts."	0.64	7	0	7	dd	2022-11-01T21:44:03Z	yjj173	t3

**price\_efficiency:** how much are you losing to the bid/ask spread? Higher number the better. 

**expected\_move:** this is a percentage of the expected move, as priced by the ATM calls and puts, for this stock by expiration date (this Friday)

How to use this in your trading? 

Do you think **DASH** will move more than 14% by Friday? If not, sell options. If you think it will move for than that, I guess you might want to go long (debit) an option (not recommended). 

Do you want to trade **INTC**? Notice how the put\_IV is double that of calls. That means traders are bidding up the puts, and bidding down the calls relative to each other. If you think its going up, sell those puts and buy the calls. 

Want to trade **SBUX**? Realize that you will lose roughly 2% immediately when filling your trade and another 2% immediately when you exit. This is how the bid/ask spread works.

wallstreetbets	predictany007	self.wallstreetbets	37	Snap, Meta shares pop after FCC commissioner says U.S. should ban TikTok	"*  Shares of U.S. social media companies Snap and Meta spiked on the news that a Federal Communications Commissioner said the U.S. government should ban TikTok.
* The comments do not necessarily signal any pending actions against TikTok.
* The Treasury and Justice Departments are the ones leading a review and negotiations with the company.

Shares of U.S. social media companies Snap and Meta spiked on the news that a Federal Communications Commissioner said the U.S. government should ban TikTok.

“I don’t believe there is a path forward for anything other than a ban,” Republican Commissioner Brendan Carr told Axios in an interview.

Snap shares were up 6% and Meta shares were up 4% Tuesday afternoon.

The comments from Carr, one of four current commissioners at the Democrat-led agency, do not necessarily signal any pending actions against TikTok.

The Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS) in the Treasury Department is reviewing the company’s potential national security implications, given its ownership by a Chinese company, ByteDance. And the Department of Justice is the one leading negotiations over a security deal, The New York Times reported in September.

Concerns over TikTok’s potential security risks are generally bipartisan. Both the Trump and Biden administrations have expressed concerns and reviewed the company’s relationship with its Chinese owner. TikTok has maintained that it stores U.S. user data outside of China so that it would not have to turn over that information to the government, but U.S. officials have maintained their skepticism.

“Commissioner Carr has no role in the confidential discussions with the U.S. government related to TikTok and appears to be expressing views independent of his role as an FCC commissioner,” a TikTok spokesperson said a statement.

For those non-gamers out there Turtle Beach is like the HTC smart phone of the gaming headset/accessory market. It is essentially universally hated. Let's remember consumer spending is down, much larger and more diverse competitors in this space are down, tech companies in general down.

**If LOGITECH is hurting TURTLE BEACH is near fatal condition**

This was Logitechs last quarterly report...

Net Income: **-41.13%**

Net Profit Margin: **-33.15%**

Top line revenue: **-12.04%**

This was Turtle Beach ($HEAR) last quarterly report...

Net Income: **-1,135.79%**

Net Profit Margin: **-2,070.78%**

Top line revenue: **-47.43%**

All this being said you must remember Logitech is a much larger company approx. 80 times the size of Turtle Beach. with a **much greater range of products.**

Sounds like Turtle Beach needs to create a much diverse range of products to compete... Well that's exactly what they have been doing although they didn't realize the recession was just around the corner. They have expanded their product line into smartphone gaming controllers, XLR microphones, and flight simulator controllers. I believe/hope that their upcoming quarterly report on 11/3 after market is abysmal. **Just check out the open interest on $7 11/18 PUTS.**

**TL;DR, $Hear is going to be buried in the sand over an increasingly difficult market to compete in while burning cash desperately trying to stay afloat.**

**Let me know what you think about this trade.**

wallstreetbets	predictany007	self.wallstreetbets	37	President Biden to float windfall tax on U.S. energy producers. Do you think it will affect energy stocks?	" 

* Shares of refiners, oil producers drop after news report
* AP reported windfall tax is being considered by White House

President Joe Biden will call on Congress to consider tax penalties for oil and gas companies accruing record profits, according to a White House official, amid stubbornly high gasoline prices that are dragging on Democrats’ midterm prospects.

This could include a so-called windfall profit tax -- which Democrats have been proposing for more than a decade without success. The idea has renewed attention among progressives in Congress after gasoline prices spiked to more than $5 a gallon this summer.

Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat and Biden ally who chairs the tax-writing Finance Committee, has floated a proposal that would impose a new federal surtax on oil companies that record a profit margin better than 10%.

The White House official didn’t confirm that Biden would specifically call for the windfall tax after AP reported earlier Monday that he would. Biden will press oil and gas companies to invest their profits in lowering costs for Americans, the official said.

The president is scheduled to deliver remarks Monday afternoon, according to the White House, on “reports over recent days of major oil companies making record-setting profits even as they refuse to help lower prices at the pump for the American people.”

Biden also could reiterate his request for Congress to eliminate a slew of tax incentives enjoyed by the industry, including a deduction of intangible drilling costs, which allows oil and gas companies to immediately deduct some expenses, such as labor, site preparation and repairs.

Administration officials have weighed a number of other steps to encourage oil refiners to keep more gasoline and diesel inside the US, instead of exporting it, as domestic stockpiles shrink ahead of winter. New restrictions on the export of finished fuels, including diesel, could be imposed administratively.

Oil industry trade groups have argued a windfall tax would penalize domestic energy and fuel production right when the US should be encouraging more of both.

“Rather than taking credit for price declines and shifting blame for price increases, the Biden administration should get serious about addressing the supply and demand imbalance that has caused higher gas prices and created long-term energy challenges,” American Petroleum Institute President and Chief Executive Officer Mike Sommers said in a statement.

“Today, the president is proposing to raise taxes on the U.S. natural gas and oil industry that is competing globally to produce the fuels Americans need every single day.”

The S&amp;P 500 Energy Index initially erased a 2% gain after the news broke but partially recovered trading up 0.9% at 2:04 p.m. in New York. Refining stocks led the declines.

The Biden proposal resembles measures that politicians across Europe, and in some other countries such as India, are imposing on companies reaping record profits from fossil fuels and power generation. Mostly, those governments are using cash raised from windfall taxes to help subsidize soaring energy bills for households.

Critics of such plans say they’ll deter companies from making the kind of investments that are crucial for increasing supply, and keeping prices down, in the future -- a charge that may have more traction in the US, which unlike most European countries is itself a major oil and gas producer.

It's a no brainer personally even though it's already up 2-3x from its  recent bottom. I can see it recovering to its 75GBX price quite quickly!

The hilarious thing is,. even after Cineworld pulled out bc of pandemic stuff, Cineplex is back trying to buy the US side of the market. If anyone knows cineworld has value, it's gotta be Cineplex - though they are for sure just trying to get cheap assets from a struggling Cineworld

wallstreetbets	11thestate	self.wallstreetbets	5	Compass Minerals International Inc ($CMP) charged for misleading investors. Time to short?	"**SEC announced that Compass (CMP) was ordered to pay $12 million to settle charges “for misleading investors** about a technology upgrade that the company claimed would reduce costs at its most significant mine, but in reality, had increased costs, and for failing to properly assess whether to disclose the financial risks created by the company’s excessive discharge of mercury in Brazil.”

According to the SEC’s order, Compass repeatedly assured investors in 2017 that a technology upgrade at its Goderich mine – the world’s largest underground salt mine which is located near Ontario, Canada, and hailed by the company as its crown jewel – was on track to materially reduce costs and boost its operating results starting in 2018. **Compass’s statements were misleading because they failed to tell investors that costs at the mine were increasing rather than decreasing, which substantially undermined the projected savings.** The SEC also found that Compass misled investors by overstating the amount of salt it was able to produce at Goderich.

The SEC’s order found that Compass violated the antifraud, reporting, and internal controls provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and various related rules.

Current and previous investors can [join a claim](https://11thestate.com/cases/419) for a further class action.

## 1. [EQT Corporation (EQT)](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NYSE-EQT/)

EQT which was founded in 1888, is one of the oldest stocks. The majority of analysts (77%) are bullish on the energy company, and they expect the stock to rally 56% from there. Analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a report last month that ETO-Top's risk-reward setup was the ""best"" among its peers heading into the winter this year.

As Europe’s gas price skyrocketing for the year and oil price globally has risen substantially this year due to the war in Russia and Ukraine providing tight supply. Europe could be headed for tough winters for the next 10 years and the supply shortages are likely the keep natural gas prices on a volatile upswing. The EQT should be benefited from tight supply and strong demand from Europe.

## 2. [General Motors (GM)](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NYSE-GM/)

General Motors was founded in 1908 and has a buy rating from 62.5% of analysts. At the current price, the stock is expected to rise 25.7%. General Motors comfortably beat earnings expectations last week, but revenue was slightly below expectations and it maintained its full-year outlook. Either way, GM reported profits a full 20 percent higher than expected, triggering the rally in GM shares. The stock rose 3.6% on earnings day and is up 6.8% in the three trading days since the results were released.

In particular, the company's ""adjusted automotive free cash flow"" in the quarter, after excluding capital expenditures and adding royalties, went from a negative $4.4 billion a year ago to an impressive positive $4.6 billion this year.

TDLR: this pump was fueled by Japanese QE, White House is increasing inflation along with Japanese. Fed will be more aggressive to win, we all know the fed don’t lose




so everyone n their mother thinks we’re up because “pivot rumors” reality is when the pivot news dropped, market went green for a few minutes then shat the bed and ran red. then a certain something happened that made us run green and started this rally. It was BOJ interventions. BOJ (bank of Japan) dumped a whopping 40-50 billion dollars that morning so they can save the collapsing yen. Granted they were and partially still in denial about the whole interference as far as I can tell but they do assure y’all that they are “monitoring the markets” and they balance sheet keeps shrinking at a rather rapid pace.

So far off my estimates (too lazy to go pull up balance sheet) but I believe it’s around 200 billion that they have dumped into the markets since “bottom” was in. to put this into perspective, QT is burning slightly under 100bil a month and these guys just wiped out 2 months worth of hard effort and pain that the fed was trying to inflict in around 3 weeks time.

And there’s no sign of them stopping….. 

Their balance sheet is slightly over a trillion so they can keep this going on for a while.


THE CONSPIRACY

This whole operation along with “pivot” rumors are all well too damn coordinated. First off, we won’t see a pivot, CORE cpi was flaming hotter than Japanese pornstars. core PCE while came under estimates; it is still rising and there’s no sign of slowdown. So ask me again, why would they pivot or even hint at a pivot? 
It’s well known the White House has been begging Powell to go easy this meeting because of the election and u bet Powell is not being swayed. If politics were to get involved Powell is a republican and he’s on his last term so if anything he’s delivering more pain. But we all know Powell is here for the American people so I think he’s just gonna do what he had already planned and that is to just do his job and crush inflation. This is his chance to go down in history like Volker did. So I think the White House likley phoned the Japanese and begged them to dump dollars or someshit idk but this was all too well coordinated of a pump. The treasury(White House) is issuing an extra 150bil in debt above estimates. They are all adding to inflation trying to counteract the fed ahead of the elections.


this is why even if Powell had 75bps planned he will be forced to go with 100bps. They can’t increase QT since it’s really very close to max in terms of liquidity drain vs bank reserves. leaving the only option as more aggressive hikes to fight off the democrats and Japanese coordinated attacks against the fed. 


I think even with 100bps it’ll take some time to bleed the Japanese dry if they keep fighting so we can go on for months green if BOJ is willing to drop all 1 trillion that it has but I’m pretty certain they’ll stop once the election ends cuz it is coordinated after all to just spoof the markets for better votes in favor of the democrats"	0.76	39	0	39	question	2022-11-01T13:37:05Z	yj6djm	t3

wallstreetbets	ProFoxxxx	self.wallstreetbets	25	Inflation has peaked?	"https://archive.ph/QkBBW


There’s one inflation gauge that bucks the trend

The New York Fed’s often overlooked UIG believes US inflation is past its peak


Whenever there’s an economic consensus on anything, it’s worth considering how it might be wrong. There seems to be general agreement that inflation and rates will be higher for longer, and “team transitory” has been defeated. But what if we are at an inflection point on inflation? This is the question policymakers should be asking. By one key measure, inflation in the US has already peaked. In fact, it peaked in March, the same month that the Federal Reserve began raising the benchmark rate.

The New York Fed’s underlying inflation gauge has largely been ignored for decades. That’s understandable, and not just because of the snoozer of a name. There wasn’t any significant underlying inflation in the years after the global financial crisis. While the Fed and financial markets are fixated on the 2 per cent inflation target, the UIG isn’t primarily a level forecast. Its real value is in predicting inflection points. It correctly anticipated the lasting high inflation we are now observing. And while it’s still high, the UIG is suggesting it will be abating.

The media and the public are obsessed with the consumer price index, while the Fed’s target is based on the personal consumption expenditures index. Both can be “noisy”, since they include the prices of volatile items such as energy and food. But they are not the only price measures. The Atlanta Fed tracks nine other indices(opens a new window) for inflation that aim to strip out noise. They show inflation somewhere between 4.7 and 7.3 per cent in September.

Most of these gauges remove data to try to identify underlying inflation. Core CPI excludes energy and food costs, for example, while trimmed mean and median measures strip out components with the largest changes in prices to smooth out the index. But the risk with these indices is that they can miss large price moves — up or down — that could be a signal of inflation changing direction.

The UIG is constructed differently, removing noise rather than items from the index. The idea is that movements in trend inflation happen alongside related changes in the trends of other economic and financial factors. The index looks at moves in prices, the labour market, financial markets and the real economy every month and checks the historical data going back to 1995 to see if similar moves had previously lasted at least a year. If so, they are included in that month’s UIG and if not, they are filtered out as noise.

You really can’t use the UIG to forecast the level of inflation, as has sometimes been suggested(opens a new window). Where it matters is in showing when the inflation trend is changing, and on this it has a decent track record in both normal and unprecedented times. When CPI hit a peak in 2018, for example, UIG clearly showed the peak while core CPI and trimmed mean and median indices suggested inflation would continue rising. In mid-2009, UIG showed a trough in inflation while the other measures took another year to reach a nadir.
What about during the pandemic? Core CPI did a good job of signalling a bottom for inflation in mid-2020 before rising, but dipped in the third quarter last year, wrongly suggesting that inflation would come down. The trimmed mean and median inflation indices failed to indicate a shift towards higher inflation, showing a trough more than six months after CPI and core CPI.

UIG found a bottom roughly in line with headline CPI and then started a steady climb upwards, rightly ignoring the slump in the third quarter of 2021. Of these metrics, it provided the earliest and most reliable signal for a rise in underlying inflation.

The Fed is now looking for signs that trend inflation has peaked and that monetary tightening is bringing inflation back towards its target. Much to its alarm, core inflation dipped in the second quarter of this year before accelerating in August and September. Median and trimmed mean inflation have been on a steady upward climb, with no signs of stabilisation. But the UIG peaked in March 2022, stabilised at high levels and has been gradually falling since July.

All the different gauges for inflation suggest it is way above the Fed’s target. But we know monetary policy works with long and variable lags, and there is a danger overtightening could spark a recession. The central bank aims to look through transitory factors and set policy based on the underlying trend. The UIG shows the trend is finally starting to reverse course. With rates now restrictive, that suggests it’s time for Fed officials to consider slowing their tightening path.

Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase. 



1) winter recession avoided 

https://m.ca.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/germany-dodges-recession-but-inflation-climbs-to-116-2811016

Why will it benefit the underlying stock? 

Spending - stocks go up in spending times bud. 

2) surprising growth,  will it be enough to outpace inflation ?  For 2023  Germany is likely to be okay, and Bayers product are essentials, during hard times Bayer makes money as well.

https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/short_news/germany-under-fire-for-canibalistic-e200-billion-investment/

3) relief plan makes  the EU  worried, if Germany avoid recession by spending, other European nations will want to follow the idea,  inflation cannot be controlled like this. EU therefore sounds the alarm and potential consequences, it is likely that not too many nations will follow suit in my opinion , Germany can afford to be spending, not many  European nations can, making Germany the exception, in fact if Germany being the biggest economy in Europe  makes it through, much of Europe will also make I through. 

The worried citi suggest the following 

*The proposals could cut 2 percentage points off inflation in the next year, according to Citi, but they are unlikely to prevent an economic contraction. The package “may soften the coming recession but also poses risks, in our view,” Citi analysts said in a note released last Friday.*

Why are we using words like economic contraction  all of a sudden instead of recession?

- **The litigations over roundup** and *glysophate*


 Bayer is still facing litigations due to the acquisition of Monsanto and RoundUp and during the last earnings call, Werner Baumann gave updated numbers. There are about 141,000 claims in total and about 108,000 have been settled.

Remember they have already set the cash aside, have won or litigated the majority of all cases. The rest are likely to head the same path.

Here is glysophate  surging 300% in 2021 https://www.agweb.com/news/crops/crop-production/glyphosate-prices-soar-much-300-and-thats-if-you-can-even-get-it

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king: 

Take a look at some of these charts in the past 59 years  have crop production globally  ever decreased over time ? Never, ever.

With crop production increasing, it drags along with it:  Crop Science

Counter point and what investors should know :


For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic. This includes recent conclusions by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the EU’s Assessment Group on Glyphosate (AGG), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), and the leading health authorities in Germany, Australia, Korea, Canada, New Zealand, and Japan.

One of Bayer's core defenses in the litigation is that the EPA has decided glyphosate is not carcinogenic and not a risk to public health."	0.84	8	0	8	dd	2022-11-01T03:00:59Z	yiuf5p	t3
wallstreetbets	illikwid	self.wallstreetbets	25	How to trade 0dte options on FOMC Wednesday - A Regard's Perspective	"PHASE 0: 9:30-1:59:59

&amp;#x200B;

trading rangebound af.  0dtes swinging +/-10% on pure delta.  theta is frozen.  buy puts on your preferred index/etf at any time.  depending on your risk tolerance and the underlying, open a limit sell order for 1.5x-3x.  pussy with spy itms? get ur +50%.  lunatic on some otm spx? go for that +200% in 5 minutes u fucking god.

&amp;#x200B;

PHASE 1: 2:00:00-2:05 

 

i dont even wanna talk about what to do if its not 75bps but just in case...

100bps: do some sick euphoric dance and start howling.  then remember u set a limit order and lose your mind as you watch your 1.5x turn into free millionaire tickets.

50bps: cry and hope jpow starts levitating and speaking in tongues.  or maybe ur a maniac with a 4100 spx call hedge in case jpow starts handing out bags of cash instead of having a press conference.

&amp;#x200B;

75bps:

instant sentiment analysis on fomc statement finds ""pivot language"" to be largely absent.  spy down 1% in seconds, maybe making it all the way to -2%. your low-return sell order goes off in 10 seconds.  you clench and maybe walk around in a circle for 5 minutes.  your longer shots sell.

&amp;#x200B;

PHASE 2: 2:05-2:33  

&amp;#x200B;

conflicting narratives enter the picture.  the gamma recedes.  hopefully you're back in cash.  maybe you're in shambles cuz ur greedy limit just had its balls tickled.  we catch our breath and say, 'hold on, lets see what pow pows gonna say.  why are we down?  it was 75bps like everyone predicted.  that was priced in.  that was an overreaction, grab up this discounted shit quick.'  

market churns and claws back some to all of phase 1 losses.  pow pow takes his sweet ass time walking up to the podium and clears his throat...

&amp;#x200B;

PHASE 3: 2:34-2:4X

&amp;#x200B;

i dont know really. probably not much happens.  powell on his prepared remarks.  maybe he throws a hawkish jab or two, or sprinkles some grass for the bulls. hold on to ur cash.

&amp;#x200B;

PHASE 4: 2:4X-EOD

&amp;#x200B;

this is where we set momentum into jobs on friday.  powell opens some q+a.  first q probably some random bullshit that pow pow deflects heroically.  then maybe another softball, maybe a few more.  then some legendary lunatic reporter grabs the mic and says, 'YO JEROME YOU FUCKING PIVOTING OR WHAT?' powell takes a moment to collect himself, then states with volume and conviction we shall not pivot.  

now we're at another crossroads.  i'd say market starts selling right the fuck off.  but maybe, just maybe, we irrational bastards are so impressed by jpows stalwart leadership that we collectively decide an economy helmed by such a man must be infallible and head off towards the moon.

you could be in position before this pivotal (fuck you) line of questioning, hoping to predict the market reaction or do a spread if ur into that shit.  or you could wait a few minutes after jpow drops the mic for the direction to become clear and jump on it.  we're not changing direction til mid thursday at the earliest.  i wouldnt even call you a pussy if you bought a thurs / fri exp instead at this point and sold it late on thurs.  if you go with a 0 day roll that shit sometime 3:30-EOD.  

at least 3 percent up or down close on wed and an additional 1-3% move in the same direction on thursday.  

&amp;#x200B;

thats it.  if you made it this far, congratulations! for even considering trading on this perspective, you are now a more degenerate member of society.  even if we strike it big, we're gonna lose it soon or spend it on food accented with gold flakes, caviar, and our own tears.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%. (Stats as of 2022-10-28)"	0.81	17	0	17	dd	2022-11-01T02:09:57Z	yitajz	t3

I have lost a lot like a lot of hard earned money in the past couple months. Last week, all I had left was $600, and I was looking on Friday Oct 28th at a Spy call (everyone was saying puts puts) but I just saw it and i was like this call this is it. But cause of all my past losses, I didn’t have the guts to press submit I just didn’t. And guess what, 2000% gains it went up 2000 frickin percent. I can’t believe I had it all was left just submit and at the end of day I could’ve gained 2000%. But I didn’t make it and I got even more scared cause I missed it cause I was scared. 

Anyway, today I was like I am not missing anything cause of fear, and I made two trades, both expired worthless so $600 is gone. 

I am sick of this. And it’s not like I just gamble. I calculate it and go for it, but I feel like the universe against me. Sometimes when I sell to break even it goes up later. And when I am like leave it let’s not just break even it will go up, no it goes down and down.

wallstreetbets	DaddyDersch	self.wallstreetbets	18	10-31-22 SPY/ ES Futues, Apple and Tesla Daily Market Analysis	"Happy Halloween! What a frightfully boring day today was… This honestly was one of the worst choppy range days I have seen in months. The total range for today on SPY was $3.14… usually we see that level of movement on the opening candle of SPY. 

The question remains where are we headed? 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sja1wwyjn7x91.png?width=931&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5af9d65c426d9ec3063ba7bd36ef14e1c078159a

Thank you to u/80hz14 for posting this in the chat today… as you can see we have a few possible scenarios and outcomes for Wednesdays FOMC meeting. Overall I would say I am in the 75bps hike and a dovish presser where jpow hints at a 50bps in December. I think we should see a 3%+ green day on Wednesday. I would be pretty shocked with rising inflation to see JPOW drop a 50bps but honestly it could happen for other reasons. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4h1f3nekn7x91.png?width=906&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9dce38d2bc2709e6acc983596099c37400eacd16

Today we saw an extreme small range day (only 39% of the 10 day average) inside day that closed as a gravestone doji. With 388.6 remaining as resistance I will be looking for downside until SPY can break free and close over that resistance level. Today we did see that the 386/ 3880 level on futures was impressively strong support. Any time SPY came anywhere near that we would see a pretty impressive pop. 

Overnight and tomorrow those will be our clear “breakout/ down” levels. From there it depends on which way markets want take us. We very well could end up with an equally as annoying range day tomorrow. However, I wouldn’t be surprised to see a small pullback tomorrow down to the 380 range. The last few FOMCs the two days leading up to it have provided a small pullback. 

Key support- 385 -&gt; 380.1 -&gt; 378

Key resistance- 388.6 -&gt; 390.2 -&gt; 393

&amp;#x200B;

Futures also had an extremely choppy overnight and intraday today. However, its daily char is closing with a double top right at 3910 and just under the daily 100ema resistance of 3925. With holding that key support of 3770 all day today we will look to those two key levels tomorrow to guide us on what direction we are going to be headed tomorrow. 

Its not impossible to believe that markets could rally tomorrow with hopeful whispers of FOMC on Wednesday but the historical trend would point to slight downside (risk off) leading into FOMC.

Key support- 3870 -&gt; 3845 -&gt; 3800

Key resistance- 3925 -&gt; 3975

Not much of a surprise after that’s unbelievable Friday that Apple had we had a pretty nice pullback on Apple, although it looks more impressive than it actually was being that Apple only closed down 1.54%. 

Apple is at a key level right here fighting between the daily 200ema of 153.4 and the daily 100ema of 152.2. Historically when it comes to Apple interacting with the 200ema it is a fight that lasts for a few trading days as the daily 200ema on Apple is a major major pivot point. I have not seen too many times where it takes a straight trend line down or up over the daily 200ema. 

Key support- 151 -&gt; 148

Key resistance- 153.4 -&gt; 155.8 -&gt; 157.4

&amp;#x200B;

Tesla remains a tricky one to get a good read on, however, as you can see we are maintaining a pretty consistent red sideways consolidation channel from 205 to 230. We have now see our 4th day in a row of Tesla rejecting the daily 20ema and refusing to close over it. However, this is now the 4th day in a row that it has closed over the daily 8ema. As you can see we are in a pretty impressive red bull channel here, however, that blue resistance and red support lines are forming a really nice rising wedge. 

Until Tesla can breakout and most importantly close over the daily 20ema I remain bearish on it. My anticipation would be that we see a move one way or another tomorrow. Key support for that red bull channel is 224.8 tomorrow which is also the 3 day support line and previous resistance line. While its not impossible I would be surprised to see Tesla hold between 230 resistance 224.8 support. 

Key support- 224.8 -&gt; 219.3

Key resistance- 230 -&gt; 234.2

You gotta love the VIX this thing just defies all logic. I am actually surprised with FOMC in two days to see the VIX unwind more like it did today, however, the VIX actually had a really impressive spike at open and closed down with a nice inside day… one of those odd days where the 10year yield, DXY and VIX were all red and SPY was red. 

Some of the issue I saw today was that over all price action, volume and momentum opened pretty bearish this morning, however, the VIX continued to unwind and I believe that led to a lot of this choppy tight range price action. The VIX is currently holding right at the same level it was prior to last FOMC where the day before fomc closed at a VIX of 27.15. 

Overall no real sense of direction for SPY tomorrow as until FOMC happens the market in my opinion is not going to play nicely and not play by the technicals. 

FOMC day is setting up to be a really nice day for some nice wins, I have posted that TA and trade plan/ analysis. Make sure you give it a read! 

10% challenge-

Today was a really tough day for me today. Actual scalp wise I did do fairly well today, however, I had my level to level calls from Friday that I should have closed the Tesla calls green this morning (regrets) and I actually ended up closing them pretty early this morning when pretty much everything pointed to downside… only for them to pop up right after I closed them. If it wasn’t for those two woulda been a decent day despite the hard price action. 

I also thing that’s something that is going to catch this market by surprise here very soon and possibly even tomorrow for pretty much the last week or two now the price action of SPY in the mornings has been pretty bearish and has also been support by volume too. However, by 11ish we have seen a complete snap of trend and 180 reversal… today just chopped instead of broke out. I wonder if we get a slight sell off tomorrow as people get caught thinking its time to buy the morning weakness.

Closing out my most profitable month of the year and also one that I do not plan to attempt to beat. Great month with some great plays. Keeping in mind that my average % gain per trade was still only 12.7% for the month. This wasn’t so much about getting random massive winners… though I had some nice wins in there too… it was more about consistent small gains that have added up over time and most importantly limiting downside risk with a -20% stop loss. 

I posted my article about that this weekend but something to keep in mind is that just because I use a -20% stop loss on my scalps doesn’t mean that is right for you. You have to find what works for your strategy and your overall profits/ trade. The whole theory is though that you can have an extremely successful strategy but if one loser wipes out all of your weeks profits or numerous days of profits then you need to manage your risk better. It’s a balancing act of having a lose enough stop to not stop out too quickly (especially on my level to level plays) BUT not having such a big stop loss that it hits and the loss takes numerous trades to overcome.

Mostly for my own records but I am going to starts separating my scalps and my level to level trades from eachother and this month of November I really wanna analyze the comparison of them and everything more closely.

wallstreetbets	predictany007	self.wallstreetbets	18	JPMorgan Says Dovish Fed Could Spark The S&amp;P 500 To Rally 10% In One Day.	"While hopes for a less aggressive Federal Reserve helped US stocks overcome last week’s flurry of disappointing earnings from tech giants, JPMorgan Chase &amp;. Co.’s trading desk now sees room for a massive rally should policy makers turn dovish when they announce their decision on Wednesday.

The S&amp;P 500 could surge at least 10% in one day if the central bank raises interest rates by a slower-than-expected half of a percentage point, and Chair Jerome Powell signals willingness at the press conference to tolerate elevated inflation and a tightening labor market, according to the bank’s sales team including Andrew Tyler. The scenario is the “least likely” to materialize, yet the “most bullish” outcome for equity investors, the team wrote in a note to clients on Monday.

Laying out every possible scenario on Fed day, the JPMorgan team is embarking on a high-stakes task of predicting market moves based on an event that has largely been positive for stocks this year. Of the six prior meetings, the S&amp;P 500 rose four times on Fed day and fell on the other two, according to Bloomberg data.

To be sure, the bank’s economists expect the Fed to boost rates by another three-quarters of a percentage point, in line with the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey, and Tyler’s team views other scenarios as less likely. Still, the exercise offers a lens into the risks that investors are grappling with.

“These outcomes are skewed to the upside as our view is that last week the market had every reason to retest lows given the disappointment from megacap tech earnings and still moved higher,” noted Tyler and his colleagues. “Several client conversations have focused on trying to identify who is the incremental seller; we think the risk/reward is to the upside.”

Below are the scenarios from the JPMorgan team on how the S&amp;P 500 could react on Fed day.

* 50 basis point hike, with a dovish press conference: “It is difficult to conceive of a scenario where this outcome occurs given inflation levels and a tight labor market,” the team wrote. “Should this outcome occur, the immediate reaction could produce a double-digit one-day return for equities.” S&amp;P 500 up 10% to 12%
* 50 basis point hike and a hawkish press conference: An outcome that could stem from a Fed that is increasingly concerned about financial stabilities as it balances growth and inflation. S&amp;P 500 up 4% to 5%
* 75 basis point hike and a dovish press conference: A scenario viewed as having the second-highest probability of playing out. “If you saw the Fed give explicit guidance for the December meeting, then that is likely viewed as a dovish outcome.” S&amp;P 500 up 2.5% to 3%
* 75 basis point hike and a hawkish press conference: “This is the most likely outcome with Powell retaining optionality for December and 2023 meetings while emphasizing the current risks to inflation moving higher.” The team also views this as the outcome most expected by bond markets, so says there may not be a significant move in yields that keeps equities from melting down. S&amp;P 500 down 1% to up 0.5%
* 100 basis point hike and a dovish press conference: While this is seen as unlikely as a 50 basis point hike, it may mean the Fed both wants a higher terminal rate and wants to complete the tightening cycle this year. “Separately, the market may digest this move as the Fed having prior knowledge of where next week’s CPI prints.” S&amp;P 500 down 4% to 5%
* 100 basis point hike and a hawkish press conference: Considered the best outcome for equity bears waiting for this latest rally to dissipate. “Here this would seem to be a Fed reassessing its own inflation forecasts, which some investors feel is too optimistic.” S&amp;P falls 6% to 8%, likely resting year-to-date lows.

Smith, Commissioner United States Securities and Exchange Commission before the American Bankers Association . . . , February 8, 1971 - when the NASDAQ began trading on February 8, 1971, as the world's first electronic stock market ""A Piece of Paper Revisited"""	"""What I want to discuss with you today is a piece of paper. It is nothing more than that, and yet it represents a great deal more. 

It is a piece of paper that vitally affects you and us and the entire financial community. It is also a piece of paper that despite being old and encrusted with a century or more of hoary legalisms has the most amazing, the most appalling reproductive capacity -- it procreates not merely subdivisions of itself but during the course of its life and travels generates an incredible number of relative pieces of paper, that cling to it, describe it, give it directions, authenticate it, transfer it, transform it, cancel it, encumber it. Like all relatives, these attachments are each very different and together very expensive.

The progenitor piece of paper to which I am referring, of course, is the stock certificate.""

\---

A lengthy read, that I'm too lazy to type it all out. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1971/020871smith.pdf)

Why did I come across this, some might ask? 

Well, I was trying to find out when stock market became electronic. Then I was wondering who programmed it.. 

Okay then, why am I curious about who programmed it?

I'm kindly regarded, hugely. But I still wonder things sometimes; If some of you are like me, and have been glued to these charts past 2'ish years - there's a kind of relative thing happening.. I can't quite describe it but as a uh, prolonged barrel-rolling sewing machine pattern, if that makes sense... and it's not 'making' something it's .. well, sort of seeding a landscape we're looking at from top-down..

Which got me to the wondering part, who was it that programmed the NASDAQ initially? 

6oo6ling that specific Q got me nothing so I broke down what I could possibly render a reasonable direction from: computer/software companies in the 60's

A few things stood out to me - IBM, Fortran, and [Harlan Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills) 

IBM because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then. 

"" In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than [4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1946%E2%80%931959:_Postwar_recovery,_rise_of_business_computing,_space_exploration,_the_Cold_War) were IBM machines. ""

&amp;#x200B;

[Fortran](https://emmachev.com/what-is-the-difference-between-pascal-and-fortran-programming-languages/) because it is a procedural, imperative, general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations. After IBM developed it in the 1950s, it soon gained popularity in programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then Harlan Mills. Just look at his timelines and titles. Specifically -  

* Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1975–81

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my thinking.. SEC knew then what we know now. Banks are assholes doing asshole stuff (if you read more of ""A Piece of Paper Revisted"" (see way above). And they figured, well, if we get rid of the human element (to some degree) this might make things more legit for more ppl than less of them. 

IBM is a huge, American computer company. Invest in America, it was the 50's/60's afterall. We were boomin' baby. And they have this Fortran language that handles all kinds of processes. Then we have Harlan Mills - I mean for all what was going on above... he has a suspiciously obvious time gap.. then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth.. pretty sus cuh.

&amp;#x200B;

All right, you've gotten this far in my rabbit hole. 

Along my tinfoil travels, I came across this other dude [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Early_years) \- he apparently influenced Harlan Mills - As an IBM research fellow, Mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development. These included automata theory, the structured programming theory of Edsger Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, and others, and Markov chain-driven software testing.

But what got me in Dijkstra's 'Legacy' section was the [Banker's alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) \- 

The Banker algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an ""s-state"" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

And this is when I came full circle on the part above I was trying to describe at ""I'm kindly regarded."" 

Anyway, this rabbit-hole kinda tripped me out. Figured a share.

A few weeks back, I mentioned the bounce was coming here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading\_spy\_next\_9\_days/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading_spy_next_9_days/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  and here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading\_spy\_week\_of\_oct\_17th/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading_spy_week_of_oct_17th/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  

Lets review the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November. 

What other macro trends do you think I missed?

Voters in five states, including four that are among the most conservative in the country, are deciding on whether to legalize recreational marijuana this election. If passed in each state, Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota would join 19 other states and the District of Columbia where cannabis has already been legalized for personal use.

All except Maryland backed Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, underscoring that the legalization effort increasingly spans the political spectrum and is even gaining support in some of the most overwhelmingly Republican parts of the nation.

A recent poll from Monmouth University shows 68% of the American public supports legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use. The support crosses gender, age, income and education differences, polling shows. In addition to the 19 states that have legalized personal recreational use, 37 states now allow pot for medical purposes.

""The more people learn about cannabis and cannabis policy, the more we see them support making cannabis legal and regulating it and treating it like alcohol,"" says Mason Tvert a partner at the marijuana policy and public affairs firm VS Strategies. ""This is an issue that is broadly supported by Americans of all political stripes, conservatives and progressives,"" he says.

wallstreetbets	MunkyR8	self.wallstreetbets	465	Airbnb earnings scheduled for tomorrow AM. Co-founder has sold off half of his remaining shares since previous quarter. Time to delete the app. It is as worthless as Facebook, excuse me, Meta.	"Airbnb, we all know it, we all have used it in the past (when it was cool). But now, if you have traveled any within the last year or two, you know that fees are tearing this company apart. It used to be cheaper to rent an airbnb compared to a hotel for the longest time. No one liked going to hotels and they were actually disrupting the hotel industry. But now, with all of the service fees, and CLEANING fees which are sometimes 100-110% of the nightly rate.

For example, here is a nightly rental in Scottsdale, AZ. For $151 a night, I pay $139 cleaning fee and $41 service fee. So after fees, you are paying effectively a 119% premium on your rental just to stay somewhere other than a hotel. Who would do that? and why? Not to mention you have to clean the place yourself, and basically do the home maker's job, because if you don't your rep gets hit. Its an absolute joke of a company now.

https://preview.redd.it/hd3muojqm6x91.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e59b111482ca40e835e93f16c70bbb87b5866ab2

So then after looking into maybe I am just biased because I hate paying these people to make me clean, I did a simple google trends search. Searches for ""airbnb"" on google actually peaked the first week of this previous quarter in July. And since then have been plummeting to nearly Dec lows. So maybe its inflation, maybe its fees, who knows but this can't be good for bookings.

[YTD chart of \\""airbnb\\"" searches](https://preview.redd.it/4a5ti97kn6x91.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f1e6193e6036377ee98f4b39f041c9eaa642ac1)

But then I do some more searching and I find this. Hosts are obv struggling to get bookings. Maybe its because your fees are insane!

https://preview.redd.it/prndr35wn6x91.png?width=2032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d93c341f44fad279542269b1fd4f172ac39b98ab

So then I started I got my crayola crayons out and started looking at the chart. The chart has been in an obvious downturn since November 2021. We are in a pretty significant downtrend, and have been consolidating since the drop in December. Looking at this chart I would expect this flag we are in currently to snap to the downside and make a new leg down which would put us near $80 a share again. Which I feel is an appropriate value given the environment we are in.

https://preview.redd.it/647nse4dp6x91.png?width=1269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1da4d592f19da06b579ada7ba0e479753a2e0739

Once I put my crayons up, I wanted to check and see what company directors and insiders have been doing with the stock considering we are near all time lows. You would think if the market for bookings and travel was expected to ""pick up"" given countries opening back up (Japan, Canada, etc.) that these insiders would be picking up stock at these cheap prices. Well... was I surprised.  Joseph Gebbia (co founder of Airbnb) was holding 2.75M shares at the beginning of Q3. He has no sold off 1.5M shares since the start of Q3, effectively cutting his position in half. FIFTY percent less than he had at the start. Sounds like someone has a confidence issue in his company's ability to disrupt the hotel industry.

https://preview.redd.it/f02i8nfup6x91.png?width=2778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c7fd40a034d34b56a77c6188dbef9a64349b3a9

Airbnb has been unable to manage fees like they have promised. They promised to ""look into it"". Nothing has changed, inflation has been destroying lower income families preventing people from taking vacations, and when they do, they are forced to go the cheaper hotel route option again. Which at the end of the day, you have less expectations as a guest, no cleaning, and sometimes even free breakfast. I am taking puts for these earnings tomorrow after close.

I am holding $90 P 11/4 and $80 P 11/4. Wish me luck fellow regards. I have convinced myself this is the beginning of the end of Airbnb. Good bye.

It's currently all over the nvidia subreddit and you can see some pictures of burned adapters. It does seem to be a systemic issue. Sometimes the GPUs is also damaged, sometimes it's fine. Anyone's guess if it's just the pci-e power adapter or the connector too. I'm seeing lots of angry customers that bought $1600 GPUs that might now go up in flames. Seems there was abysmal quality control and they rushed the launch.

More importantly, there isn't any official news or statement from nvidia yet (as far as I can see, please correct me if I'm wrong). I'm sure some nvidia engineers are shitting their pants right now though.

Anyway I'm thinking this can't be good for their stock price, so be prepared for a green dildo out of nowhere.

wallstreetbets	Victor21992	self.wallstreetbets	23	Using CCs to reduce cost basis, and then selling more CCs off the new shares	"Hi all, hope someone smarter than me could help me out with a simple question. I own a large number of shares of the world's worst stock. If I were to sell CCs against it, I understand that the premium is instantly available to use to buy whatever. The leaps of this shitty meme stock 2 years out go for a huge premium, which I could use to bring my cost basis down drastically. My question is, say I sell CCs 2 years out, and take the premium to buy even more shares, could I then sell CCs on those new shares purchased, in a sort of endless loop (it would be a bit like an asymptote I imagine), whereby I would eventually nearly double the amount of shares I own?

As far as I know, the downside would be that my max gain is limited to the strike price that I am selling at 2 years out. However, for me, since I am doubling my shares and choosing a strike that is far off the current price, this would be more than worth it and I would sell the moment the stock hits that price anyway.

Can anyone tell me if this is possible and makes sense, or am I being an idiot?

MSOS	"https://www.marijuanamoment.net/schumer-says-congress-is-very-close-to-passing-marijuana-banking-and-expungements-bill-after-work-with-a-bunch-of-republicans/

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says Congress is getting “very close” to introducing and passing a marijuana bill with provisions covering banking access for legal businesses and expungements of past convictions, citing progress he’s made in discussions with a “bunch of Republican senators.”

During a debate with his Republican reelection opponent Joe Pinion on Sunday, Schumer was asked about a separate broader cannabis legalization bill he filed this year and whether he felt it would make more sense to first promote more research into marijuana before ending prohibition.

While the top senator said that research is “very, very important,” he pointed out that “many states have approved legalization of cannabis,” and so the policy is already “upon us.”

wallstreetbets	predictany007	self.wallstreetbets	20	Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Says End of Fed Tightening Nearing	"The end of the Federal Reserve’s campaign to raise interest rates is approaching, according to Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson, who until recently was a prominent stock market bear who correctly predicted this year’s slump in equities.

Indicators including the inversion of the yield curve between 10-year and three-month Treasuries -- a recession indicator with a perfect record -- “all support a Fed pivot sooner rather than later,” Wilson wrote in a note on Monday. “Therefore, this week’s Fed meeting is critical for the rally to continue, pause or even end completely.”

All eyes will be on the US central bank, which is widely expected to raise rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday for a fourth time, while investors will be dissecting Chair Jerome Powell’s commentary for guidance on future moves. US stocks have rallied over the past two weeks as traders parsed economic indicators for signs of the impact of Fed tightening, even as Big Tech earnings disappointed.

“This kind of price action isn’t unusual toward the end of the cycle particularly as the Fed moves closer to the end of its tightening campaign, something we think is approaching,” said Wilson, who was ranked the best portfolio strategist in the latest Institutional Investor survey. The rally will hold up until the next 12-month earnings-per-share estimates pull back more meaningfully, he said.

Separately, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists said the potential down shift in the pace of Fed tightening, coupled with light positioning and anticipation of strong fourth-quarter seasonality is behind the lift for equity markets in recent weeks.

Morgan Stanley's (MS) Michael Wilson says the end of the Fed's interest rate hike campaign is approaching. The next FOMC meeting is scheduled on November 2 wherein it is expected that the Fed will hike the rates with another 75bps.

wallstreetbets	InsidersBets	self.wallstreetbets	15	What is your overall sentiment in your country?	"I live in the US and I would say the sentiment is overall bearish due to the recent price correction over the past few months in stocks/cryptos, the war in Ukraine, US-China tensions, inflation, etc. I’d be interested to see what everyone’s take on the current sentiment in your country and the reasoning behind this. 

I do believe in time the market will recover but we very well could see further declines before we get a solid rebound/support. I think we need to see an end to the Ukraine war and the tapering of inflation world wide before we will see a sustained broad market gain. 

As of recently we’ve seen some price stability in many different industries, with energy leading the pack. This very well could be the support I mentioned but with the amount of uncertainty still world wide, any macro event will cause greater uncertainty and further price declines. While short term levels appear to be holding in the broad market, a break of this support would lead us to retest the March 2020 lows. Of course, this is all my speculation and anything can happen with the stock market.

wallstreetbets	PopperChopper	self.wallstreetbets	67	$ABNB puts or calls? Earnings play.	"I’m buying puts. Currently hold 108p for this Friday. 

My thesis is based on:

-online sentiment is garbage. Hosts and guests all complaining about bookings, fees, algorithms

-travel season is slowing down. Pandemic is over. Not getting that boost in bookings from people stuck at home. 

-the fees have gotten to a point where hotels are more attractive. I think that’s has been the case for long enough to have the market digest and suffer the consequence. I believe it will be reflected in revs.

-I heard insiders have been selling but I am not familiar enough with the company itself to rationalize exactly why. 

-regulation in some markets. 

-the niche has been bastardized by hosts looking to make a living on short term hostel style rentals. Abnb was useful for unique venues or renting a place that is otherwise not available through traditional travel avenues. Renting a bullshit converted room for $350+fees for the night is not what suits Abnb. 

-even if earnings are decent coming off of summer, I expect forward guidance to sink 

-earnings has been rough for all tech

-they trade at a hubris 50-60x P/E ratio 

Counter points: 

-travel stocks have been doing well. 

-market is irrational 

-we are still coming off of summer booking numbers this quarter which may be decent 

-people love future growth companies like Abnb

My cousin is currently stuck in a major highway in the southern state of Santa Catarina because of protests blocking major highways and refusing to let truck drivers through.

"I have just started a job recently and they have a retirement package through fidelity. I went over the package several times and I am curious about which is a better selection for me to put my aftertax funds into my retirement account. 

**Are the S&amp;P 500index/US Small/Mid Cap Index a better choice for retirement planning than the Target Retirement funds?** 

Right now through fidelity it lists that as of 09/12/2022:

S&amp;P 500 index has a 1Y return of 28.71%

US Small/Mid Cap Index 1Y return of 12.51%

while (based on my birthday) the Target Retirement 2065 fund 1Y return is 16.57% (MSCI US broad Mkt is 26.10% which might be better choice than just the target retirement since it is a blend of a few things)

I have always had the impression that the S&amp;P 500 index is a more predictable and reliable growth for a portfolio than the basic Target Retirement (20XX) funds. Which buckets would you put your money into to get more aggressive returns in the next 20 years?

Here's a situation I'm trying to wrap my head around.

Purely  for day trading purposes, when there is no intention of holding  overnight, we're often presented with a situation where we can choose to  trade Index / Index ETFs options or options on a particular stock we expect a higher percentage move from.  There might be relative  strength we can play off of in individual issues, but strategically, how do we best balance that vs the dramatic convexity possible with zero  days?

I was faced with this choice  last week trading SPY options or NFLX and feel like this is a topic  where I could improve my understanding, and therefore, my results.

I  think this must have to do with the size and probability of the  expected move, but that's going to interact with the options pricing.  I  know this has to do with the convexity and gamma, but I'm trying to get  my head around that in a way that's useful for real time day trading  (NOT scalping).

2. Oil Prices to spike as soon as we finish this election and the strategic petroleum Reserves stops getting used. - Get ready for a cold and expensive winter.
3. Another spike in this inflation game - well over 10-12%. This forces the fed's hand on holding the rates higher for longer.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.

**Pharmaceuticals** ( which has seen an insane amount of investments towards bio sciences , from diabetes , blood pressure,  vets , cancer  and hundreds of more areas ) 

**And consumer health** which is always growing. 

**TheTop 2 problems and why they are going in favour if Bayer** 

**1) litgations 2) europe economy**

Quickly as for the European Economy it is worth noting that Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase.

- **The litigations over roundup** and *glysophate*

 Bayer is still facing litigations due to the acquisition of Monsanto and RoundUp and during the last earnings call, Werner Baumann gave updated numbers. There are about 141,000 claims in total and about 108,000 have been settled.

Remember they have already set the cash aside, have won or litigated the majority of all cases. The rest are likely to head the same path.

Here is glysophate  surging 300% in 2021 https://www.agweb.com/news/crops/crop-production/glyphosate-prices-soar-much-300-and-thats-if-you-can-even-get-it

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king: 

Take a look at some of these charts in the past 59 years  have crop production globally  ever decreased over time ? Never, ever.

1.  Since they have taking over the company  that use to make roundup, they have face countless of lawsuits, where  claimants claim  Glysophate caused cancer 

Counter point and what investors should know :


For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic. This includes recent conclusions by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the EU’s Assessment Group on Glyphosate (AGG), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), and the leading health authorities in Germany, Australia, Korea, Canada, New Zealand, and Japan.

https://www.bayer.com/en/roundup-litigation-five-point-plan

One of Bayer's core defenses in the litigation is that the EPA has decided glyphosate is not carcinogenic and not a risk to public health."	0.87	12	0	12	question	2022-10-31T01:08:08Z	yht7x5	t3

Natural-gas prices have fallen more than 40% since hitting shale-era highs in late August, reducing the risk of [budget-busting heating bills](https://www.wsj.com/articles/higher-heating-bills-poised-to-hit-u-s-households-this-winter-11665805210?mod=article_inline) this winter for millions of Americans and potentially easing a major cost pressure for manufacturers.

The decline is due to warm autumn weather, record domestic production and gas-storage facilities that have filled up fast since the end of air-conditioning season. Now, one of the big drivers of inflation costs roughly the same as it did a year ago. 

Analysts warn that unusually cold weather could send prices soaring anew this winter, [especially in the Northeast](https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-england-risks-winter-blackouts-as-gas-supplies-tighten-11665999002?mod=article_inline) where maxed out pipelines have effectively capped output from Appalachia’s prolific producers.

Yet many are forecasting that prices will be lower on average in 2023 than they were this year. They expect rising supply from increasingly efficient North American drillers along with slower-growing demand from an economy throttled back by central bankers trying to [slow inflation with higher borrowing costs](https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-set-to-raise-rates-by-0-75-point-and-debate-size-of-future-hikes-11666356757?mod=article_inline). 

Natural-gas futures priceSource: Dow Jones Market DataNote: Front-month contractsNov. 2020'21'2212345678$9per million British thermal units

Natural-gas futures for December delivery ended Friday at $5.684 per million British thermal units, just 4.75% higher than a year ago. Early last week, futures slipped below $5 for the first time since March, when energy markets were jolted by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Permian Basin producers in recent days swamped the Waha trading hub in West Texas, pushing prices into negative territory. In some cash trades, sellers paid buyers more than $1 per million British thermal units to take away gas that was fetching more than $8 at the start of September, according to S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights.

 

Analysts say futures prices are likely to rise a bit once furnaces fire up and a big liquefied-natural-gas export terminal in Texas resumes operations following [a fire this summer](https://www.wsj.com/articles/natural-gas-prices-plunge-after-extended-outage-at-texas-lng-facility-11655235895?mod=article_inline). But they expect prices to decline next year.

Goldman Sachs analysts forecast that benchmark U.S. prices would average $5 per million British thermal units in 2023. BofA Securities anticipates $4.50. Through Friday, natural-gas futures this year have averaged about $6.60 per million British thermal units, straining not just household budgets but also the gas-consuming makers of materials ranging from steel and cement to plastic and [fertilizer](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chemicals-giant-to-cut-production-of-key-fertilizer-ingredient-amid-russian-gas-crisis-11658918219?mod=article_inline).

Investors are betting on cheaper gas, too. Hedge funds and other speculators in recent weeks have built up their biggest collective wager that prices will fall since the panic selloff during the Covid lockdown in early 2020, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show.

Rising natural-gas prices have been a safe bet since the early days of the pandemic. Some of the hottest weather on record stretched supplies at home and abroad, while the closure of [coal-fired power plants](https://www.wsj.com/articles/red-hot-coal-prices-threaten-more-increases-in-power-bills-11654167025?mod=article_inline) left electricity producers without an alternative to natural gas. After Ukraine was invaded, European utilities and manufacturers bid up boatloads of shale gas to [replace Russian exports](https://www.wsj.com/articles/nord-stream-blasts-were-likely-result-of-sabotage-german-probe-finds-11666016047?mod=article_inline).

U.S. natural-gas inventories ended the past heating season drawn down to nearly 18% below normal levels. Another steamy summer, strong exports and restraint among North American drillers [focused on shoveling cash to their shareholders](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-surging-natural-gas-prices-havent-sparked-a-drilling-boom-11651623490?mod=article_inline) kept domestic storage facilities from filling up much. By August, stockpiles were still nearly 13% below normal and [prices pushed above $10](https://www.wsj.com/articles/endless-demand-spurs-u-s-natural-gas-prices-to-shale-era-highs-11661245053?mod=article_inline) for the first time since 2008, when the shale-drilling boom was [just getting started](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-texas-well-that-started-a-revolution-1530270010?mod=article_inline).  

Mild weather in September meant a lot less gas burned to power air conditioners. Meanwhile, U.S. production [rose to a record](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-news-today-09-19-2022/card/u-s-natural-gas-output-hit-a-record-high-inJ6nHpFHfQkMNYSXVo5?mod=article_inline) of more than 100 billion cubic feet a day and the prolonged outage at Freeport LNG’s Texas export terminal made available a lot of gas that otherwise would have been sold overseas. 

Traders began pumping more gas into storage tanks and caverns, socking it away for winter when demand is greatest.

Between Sept. 9 and Oct. 14, 571 billion cubic feet of gas were added to stockpiles, the biggest build ever over five weeks. The deficit to normal levels shrank by more than half. As of a week ago, the volume of gas in storage was within 5.5% of normal levels for this time of year, according to the Energy Information Administration.

 

Matthew Palmer, executive director of Global Gas at S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights, said the firm expects U.S. inventories to fill even more and begin winter in line with recent years, at around 3.6 trillion cubic feet. 

“That should be ample for most weather scenarios,” he said. A really cold winter, however, like the frigid season of 2013-14, which sucked nearly 3 trillion cubic feet from storage, could push prices north of $10, he said. "	0.9	42	0	42	news	2022-10-31T00:41:32Z	yhsg96	t3

wallstreetbets	v10climbz	self.wallstreetbets	28	Diamondback Energy for the Win. (FANG)	"So let me teach you degenerates a little about the oil and gas industry. They have a P/E ratio of 7.45 their EV/EBITDA is steadily decreasing its currently at around a 10.0. Debt to equity ratio is around .41 and continues to decline over the past five years. When looking into oil companies you need to understand something called proven reserves. These are the oil/gas reserves the company has access to but doesn’t utilize all at one time. They have it under lease (mineral lease) per acre of land. Almost all their reserves are in Texas which isn’t a bad things. Often oil companies list these reserves on their balance sheet or especially their income statements. Be very wary of companies that do this. Diamond Back isn’t one of them. 

They have 1.8 billion barrels of oil under their control. Which is very good they can keep the wheel spinning for years. They deal primarily in unconventional shale horizontal drilling operations. That basically means they drill down into a porous oil rich shale rock turn the drill head into the oil producing zone and go horizontally for a couple miles. They then put a perforator with explosive charges on it and send it down into the hole. They then blow up the shale allowing the oil and gas to flow smoothly. They have multiple years of drilling possibilities and peak production in the Permian basin isn’t expected until 2028. Plenty of time for profit to be made. I wouldn’t hold this company for more then two years because their business model isn’t going to last forever, just long enough for the stock price to move up as the continue to increase their cash flow. Their operating cash flow jumped to 3.5 billion last quarter. These wells in the Permian and Eagle Ford shale can be redrilled in multiple directions and multiple depths. All you need to know is Permian Basin/Eagle Ford/west Texas/Eastern New Mexico is all very prime drilling opportunities rich with oil and accessible drilling formations. It’s cheap to drill in Texas. The average break even price for the Eagle Ford is actually 49$ per barrel for a new well. These shale wells won’t produce for more then four years so these companies will eventually be in trouble but that prediction is far from the 10ks they’ll produce over the next five years. 

But talking about oil companies we also need to talk about the price of oil. Most of these oil companies in west Texas produce profit at 53$ a barrel for new wells. There’s a lot of money to be made. OPEC+ supply cuts seem like they’re here to stay. Inflation seems high as well. Projecting oil WTI at around 85-105 a barrel for the next year. Record profits to be expected yet the P/E ration in oil and gas is low. Nobody thinks oil is the future. It isn’t but these companies and their liquidity streams aren’t going anywhere in the next five years. Revenue will keep going up for small/medium cap US shale producers. Record profits to be expected yet no one is holding these companies because they don’t wanna seem environmentally unconscious. They’re a bargain for the retail investors. Some of the best value in the market is in the oil and gas sector. DM me for more oil companies.

I'm ash and write detailed DD on stocks and events, so last week I published my Full plan and analysis.In this post, we will cover

* $2k to $100k Challenge Update
* This week’s Earnings
* This Week's Major Economic Events
* This week’s Watchlist
* This Week’s lotto 10 bagger Play

Ok so let's get this show on the road

# $2k to $100k Challenge Update

For those of you who dont know, im 17 trading days in challenge where i trade live everyday, starting with $2k (actually $1.8k) and trade my way to $100k, live in front of everyone everyday.

**Options Starting Amount:** $1000

**Day 17 Closing Amount:** $5038

**Port % Change:** 400%  
**Proof:**

https://preview.redd.it/m7dh205b10x91.jpg?width=1633&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ecf4dece8117c832473836daf9665ea89ced868

**Futures/Commodities Starting Amount:** $800

**Day 17 Closing Amount:** $1500

**Port % Change**: %87.5

I found that people for the most are not really interested in Global/Futures plays, but if you guys want i can definitely add that to the watchlist next week. Let me know in the comments.

This week we gained big by predicting 2 main moves, the drop on the GDP release, we ran on very bad news for Feds, the drop was inevitable. And another big gainer was PCE release, got in PM into SPX calls when i saw Bullish divergence between price action and RSI and added size after PCE meet expectation as it was good news for the Feds and PCE is one of powells favorite metrics to look at for rate hikes.

The following is basically my plan for next week.

# Major Economic Events

**Monday 10/31**

9:45 AM Chicago PMI

10:00 AM Dallas Fed Manufacturing Index Oct

**Tuesday 11/01**

9:45 AM S&amp;P Global PMI Final Oct

10:00 AM ISM Manufacturing PMI Oct

10:00 AM Jolts Job Openings Sep

**Wednesday 11/02**

8:15 AM ADP Employment Change Oct

2:00 PM Fed Interest Rate Decision

2:30 PM Fed Press Conference

**Thursday 11/03**

8:30 AM Balance of Trade Sep

10:00 AM ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI Oct

**Friday 11/04**

8:30 AM Non Farm Payroll Oct

8:30 AM Unemployment Rate Oct

So all these are very important events that will move the market, but the offcourse the important event is the Fed Conference on wednesday which is the only event ill playing.

So my play here is in 2 parts.

Part 1 - The Rate Hike

Believe it or not the rate hike is not that important and is unlikely to affect the market that much, let me explain.

https://preview.redd.it/owgfdped10x91.png?width=1262&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a466d5bcb721e09c65cc449128a726a17b262b77

As of Friday 28Oct the market is pricing

0% chance of 100Bps

81.3% chance of 75Bps

18.7% chance of 50Bps

Now in my previous watchlist we have been predicting the rate hikes right every single time by just following the highest odds, the Fed doesnt like to freak the market. They also dont want the market to rally too much so its also unlikely that we get 50Bps, in addition to that why do 50Bps when they can get away with 75Bps without freaking out the market.

In all cases, they definitely not doing 100bps, if they do 75bps as expected we run a little (ill tell why a little later on) if they 50Bps we run alot. It seems to me for the first part the very obvious play here is calls before the rate hike, and sell on the spike for that delicious IV spiked premium.

Part 2 - The Meeting

Well this is where it gets very tricky, so as you may know that market has been rallying lately and thats because alot of people are expecting the Fed to pivot, or at least start talking about pivoting this time.

If they say we are pivoting the run continues at least till we hit the 200MA on the SPX 1D chart, if they we cant do that yet, we are getting new 52 week lows.

This part is easy to figure the part is figuring out whether they will pivot or not, for funsies ill give you my expectations, but honeslty im going to play it by ear. Im 50/50 on what they plan to do, and the move will be so big you can get in at time and still make $$, you can also do a straddle.

Anyway Looking at the PCE report inflation is not so bad, thats why ran hard after the report was out, its not the best report in the world, but its an improvement for sure, add to that the St. Louis Fed came out with report stating the Fed is wrong to look only at CPI as it is lagging data heavily weight down with rent prices going up and that if we remove rent, inflation has actually cooled off and we are actually deflating now.

The fed doesnt want to risk deflation by forcing a recession when we dont really need to. (This is a much worse scenario than inflation, thats why the Fed is being careful)

On the other hand, GDP came out pretty damn positive, the so called earnings recession and end of the world stock market destruction is nowhere to be seen. While some growth tech companies ‘’missed’’ (most of them just lowered guidance, they didnt actually miss) most of the not so sexy companies beat. This is good for the stock market, VERY bad for the feds, this means that demand is not getting crushed, and if demand is high, prices will likely remain elevated. So all this might signal to the Fed that job not done yet, we need more pain.

As you can see there are very good reasons for the Fed to go either way, i think we get a pivot for an important reason no one is really talking about. The US treasuries the most liquid market in the world, is losing its liquidity. With UK and Japan selling US Treasures to prop up their currienses and markets and the Fed tightening and no longer buying assets this is starting to affect the treasuries market.

Guys if treasure market goes no bid or crashes, 2008 + 2001 + Great depression will NOT even come close to the global collapse that we might experience. Central Banks Chairs around the world have been pestering Powell about that recently. I think they will do anything to make sure that doesnt happen.

But like i said we shall see.

# Watchlist

**- $TSLA Long**

https://preview.redd.it/xf5d6mcf10x91.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0ee3eae96a82cee42fcf3f93488dfd70d3e66a5

If TSLA continues its run, and finally break the 230 resistance, we can easily see a run to $250 level, will take calls on Monday

**- $SPY Short**

https://preview.redd.it/q96wt5pg10x91.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=278dc0bbd5025aca467cb822a03603f7ecd7a914

Whether we run or not after FOMC the 1Hr is VERY over extended, and we are due a pullback, its not going to be a sharp one likely but still could make for a nice trade.

**- $PIN Long**

https://preview.redd.it/em2jx6hh10x91.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=754fa108ef21a21dc4a22bb0b10c6c4d855fd71c

Strong beat by PINS still has room for more if it breaks the $25.9 resistance we can get $27.95, quickly, taking some call here for a possible run

**- $DB Short**

https://preview.redd.it/bt550y5i10x91.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20ba5802ea52e0d4b92c01b6f45dd1e765f2b507

Ran so much on that earnings beat, creating a short gap fill to $9.5. Its also very Overbought on the Daily chart making a nice %3 move down at least, picking up some puts as long as it doesnt move down before the open

# Bonus Potential 10 Bagger Play

Alright boys and girls so played this one before as 10 bagger and we got our 10 bag (and then some) But this one has more left in the tank for another run.

Its NFLX baby.

So we ran hard before and on earnings securing our 10 bag ( This was my firs 10bag call on my first watchlist, check my profile for proof).

Now it crossed the 200MA on the daily chart after filling half the gap so take a little rest. What we are looking for here is for NFLX to reclaims 50 and 21MA  on the 1hr time frame. Once we get we reclaim that we will continue to fill the remainder of the gap fill all the way to $330

I know we're heading into a recession, but I really do think that the Metaverse is going to be a thing. Mark just sucks at presenting, he's like Alex karp. All they need is the right hype man and I bet it takes off.

PFE's financials have been stellar during the pandemic. So stellar that they're being investigated for hiding profits. If true, investors should be livid as PFE also pays a dividend and they're opening themselves up to potential IRS back taxes, interest and penalties.

With Covid mostly behind us, they're mitigating declining sales with a price hike.

[https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/pfizer-expects-price-covid-vaccine-110-130-per-dose-2022-10-20/](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/pfizer-expects-price-covid-vaccine-110-130-per-dose-2022-10-20/)

Pfizer has proven themselves when it comes to vaccines. They're fully able to develop, test, manufacture and distribute when other countries are still going into lockdowns. Let's also give credit to Johnson and Johnson, Moderna and the little guys for creating the competitive environment. Whatever PFE reports on Tuesday, it will surely drag these guys with them.

My take on the future. Covid vaccine sales will continue to decline as we move forward and the other divisions within Pfizer will continue to flat line with little to no growth. But if there is another pandemic, put down the banana and back up the truck."	0.72	21	0	21	question	2022-10-30T19:31:52Z	yhkejb	t3

Well here we are today: 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jxh9aqfteyw91.png?width=777&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06f32f3d05c6bc26be5ff18152c866a2f8002709

The ""next meeting"": 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ghkwxf4cfyw91.png?width=775&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=073a9298174403edcdc2b943669d6bcc325510df

So what is happening here? Well somehow the idea of a 50 point hike next meeting has creeped into the odds and especially over the last week went from 5% to 17.8%. 75 is still ""expected"" but its interesting to see a window open to this idea. 

The next meeting calls for 125-150 bps by the Dec meeting. The odds of 125 are going up while the 150 is going down. Well why is this and what does the market know that you don't? Lets start with the obvious: 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mgqaiyusgyw91.png?width=1072&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=afd95fb2cf12131dae02f2c184c1c0f1aff47d4e

See that initial 6% rise and 8% crash? Thats the market being under the impression the fed is doing two 75bps hikes in a row. But something happened on the CPI day (the big green bar there). The CPI report was not good. It did not show CPI came down. They told you the market was ""oversold"" and ""due for a bounce"". But narratives are always built after the price action was decided. 

Well lets keep in mind the date the CPI report was posted 

&amp;#x200B;

[Oct 13 for the smooth brain](https://preview.redd.it/6ntp5dqfhyw91.png?width=1044&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1021a7ef90945a09b36465e209ef329f9eba543c)

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/na03sgbyhyw91.png?width=727&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7499aa88531f652c774b0977b4d41737a3a801e9

""Last Friday"" was Oct 14th, the day after the CPI report was posted and the market retreated back, only to close higher and never return to this level again. How long does it take to setup a meeting? 24 hours? Whoever bought up the CPI day simply knew something we all don't. Then word gets out after the Friday meeting and the market only gets bought up. 

They know the fed's next meeting before its even occurred. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pl1sbwo5jyw91.png?width=599&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1863e87751ef465b2d537d8119cf729962aa67e8

If you knew the fed was going to get all flowery and use some fancy pivot language the market can interpret as bullish and run with, you would buy everything up too, especially at those beautiful lows we had. 

To those paying attention, the fed is basically telling you without telling you all the way back on the 21st: 

 [Fed's Daly: Time to start talking about slowing interest-rate hikes - MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/feds-daly-wants-to-start-talking-about-step-down-in-super-sized-pace-of-interest-rate-hikes-11666372382)

Then the bank of Canada starting giving more credence to this idea. 

https://preview.redd.it/dgzj9zdwjyw91.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5de4271ea7676f82bba69e2ac09e3c667dd1dac

So the fed does a dovish meeting. The market can't rally that hard...right?  Wrong:  


[July 25-Aug 23. First big green bar is the July 27 fed meeting](https://preview.redd.it/1n27swtdkyw91.png?width=1067&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e38b5ad34742acb1667c2928a807bf04ff583a3d)

Just the broader market went on to rally a good 10% from the previous days level. So what if it did it again? 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7c3ox000lyw91.png?width=1078&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a04ee4d74cee0196525bad4614ec00a8bbace38

Well to get back and re-test that Aug high, you would need an 11% rally (greater than the last one), thus it is already built out to fail making a higher high and simply fall back down again later. We have no idea what number they will send the market to in front of the meeting so we can't measure it out, but one thing we can deduce is that there is some extremely heavy volume with the market being low like it was. This indicates incredible interest at these price levels. AKA accumulation for the next move.  Now are all these accumulators just going to paper hands when they just got done buying tf out of the market? No. They are going to let the sneeze play out and let short coverings/you drive the market up after the fed meeting. 

What will they do with the prices in front of the meeting? Who honestly knows. Probably send the market down a lil and then show you some fancy charts about why it was ""overbought"" and blah blah blah just for you to witness the entire market up another 5% a week from now. Probably some profit takers and re buy ins in front of it is how itll go. 

&amp;#x200B;

A rally here into at least mid November makes sense also from the standpoint this is a strong seasonal period for stocks especially around midterms. It is highly unlikely JPOW is going to get up there and call for a 1 bps this meeting and next in front of something highly political like this. Besides, Powell is already getting political pressure now: 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/azmg105onyw91.png?width=947&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02ce6bda4affd768e17ecbd6d6cc99d6d6c68c4d

Well here is how that all went down:  


https://preview.redd.it/itz5j2stoyw91.png?width=825&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=007f6a54cf0f897f932b501aad6b377254c843f3

You can see the market was going through it heading into the mid terms. But some miracle occurred that put the crash on hold between the specific dates of Oct 29th and Nov 8th there was something special about that day. Who knows what that could have been about. I just have no idea! 

You heard before ""Dec is a great time to buy stocks! Its so seasonally strong! The consumer can bench press $500k worth of debt and squat another $1 milly!"" 

There's an old fashioned phrase in the game called exit liquidity. These banks all calling for a recession in 2023 are not wrong. But if you got caught flat footed (we know  some already did aka credit swiss\*) then you need to pass your bags along because all that bully the market rhetoric from Powell caught you off guard and your bags are getting a little too heavy lately. Dec was perfect last hike cycle for exit liquidity, will probably be again. 

I lastly leave you with the beautiful game of guessssssssssssss that chart! Can you guess what caused it to run in the first place and why it stopped? These all are random popular stocks from 07/27-08/16 on an hourly timeframe:

Of that, due to high insider and institutional holdings, only about 10 million are available for trading. 20 million shares short interest give it a 200% SI. $GME had SI of 150% at its high. Not saying my calculated setup is a guarantee for a squeeze but a good start. Daily price swings on low volume indicate that the stock is tight as hell.

Also, $GEO, while still heavily leveraged has underlying assets that give the company a fair share price of about $20, based on reproduction values of recent transactions. Not even included here is their subsidiary which is a cash machine.

It‘s basically one of a few stocks that will hold up during a recession, make their interest payments leverage less problematic relative to the increasing rates in general, and provide a big margin of safety, since the company provides enough FCF to deleverage and has enough assets to sell for deleveraging.

If you don‘t like the fact that GEO also operates correction facilities, spare me with your woke opinion, it‘s about making money."	0.38	0	0	0	question	2022-10-30T10:20:17Z	yh8vtm	t3

Came across this article and wanted to get other people's opinions about it. Monster (MNST) according to the link's author says the energy drink company is undervalued. Has anyone noticed shortages in their respective areas when shopping at all? My thinking is you can buy them everywhere here locally for 2 for $5, 3 for $7. They seem to go fast everywhere.

wallstreetbets	lospepes0	self.wallstreetbets	16	Bullish case for growth stocks	"Growth stocks have been hammered this year because of the prospect of higher interest rates. 
Using the future discounted cashflows valuation, higher interest rates mean higher discount rates in the denominator of the cashflows and lower valuations.
However, higher inflation increases the multiplers of the cashflows and the valuations. 

What matters is the annual difference between inflation and interest rates. The higher the difference, the higher the valuation. 

Another factor is that companies may have lower returns in the next couple of years due to a recession, which lowers their valuation. 

My point is: 

Growth stocks don't need to worry as much about lower short term returns. Their short term returns were going to be small anyways compared to their long term returns. 

No need to worry about interest rates much either. They are still well below the inflation rate and the FED can't increase rates too much for too long because that will crash the economy and make national debt unsustainable. If they crash the economy they will have to lower rates again and keep doing more QE lol 

On the other hand, we can't control inflation as much. There's currently a trend towards reversing globalization, which will increase prices no matter what interest rates are. This will decrease the revenue of many companies buying/selling goods internationally. However, a lot of growth stocks SELL services internationally, mostly software, communications, and entertainment. They aren't affected by commodities as much. Higher inflation means higher returns for these companies over the long run, which should increase their valuation. Plus many these companies have already fallen more than 30-40%...

As soon as the markets start to see that interest rates don't go up so much and that inflation is still kind of high, the dollar will plummet and growth stocks will go to the moon 🚀🚀"	0.56	2	0	2	question	2022-10-30T03:42:05Z	yh1fb9	t3

wallstreetbets	JournalistFew2794	self.wallstreetbets	23	I have elaborated Charts to explain why META plummeted and why we should (if) be concerned	"Here we go. A very clear chart showing the trend of META's **quarterly revenue**, the polemic **R&amp;D expense as a % of total revenue** and the **Free Cash Flow generated in the same period**. I have plotted the last 9 periods (quarters) so you can see the trend and then we will compare with the chart of Meta share price where you will see clearly why/how the market is concerned. 

Take 1 minute to read properly and understand the trend:

[Yes, FCF my friends. The FCF!!!!!!](https://preview.redd.it/e8n65aywxsw91.jpg?width=791&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4a4451bb8606c90e5ebc61359f7a8730f7234d7)

So what is the problem with the above chart?

The FCF has been ERASED! The only big tech that has decided to smash its cash flow generation capacity. Zuck doesn't care. He is all in into the METAVERSE. F\* you shareholders. Investment returns? You should have bought APPLE.

That's why you see the following QoQ share price action in the same period (I have plotted 99$ in Sep 30, but it should be 27 Oct):

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ixamkk9jysw91.jpg?width=791&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78772ec49e6c324d8e4f48add37ba5476178d434

But hold on, what is all that cash burn rate? What is Zuckerberg doing with our cash?

Well he anounced the following:

&amp;#x200B;

|In Billions $|2022|2023|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Total Expenses|86|100|

100 F\*ing Billion per year! Hey Regards, he could be buying your entire GME company 12 times each of these 2 years. 

But... was this a SHHURPRISE? Mmm... no! This is what he already anounced last year, and the stock did a rally from 320$ to the 340$ after releasing this:

&amp;#x200B;

[So still spending 10 Billiones below what he told us for FY2022](https://preview.redd.it/82o77zt30tw91.jpg?width=1560&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97950cce7dfe04df98895f0b8e0ebf757d69e4ef)

The capital he will allocate in CAPEX will be 33-34 Bn$ each year, in 2022 and 2023. This is basically data centers, servers, and network infrastructure. As he says, ""increase in AI capacity""

So...

how is the cash position of META compared to the other big techs? The below data is Cash and Cash equivalent LESS Debt.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/g1h23m1j0tw91.jpg?width=724&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e3dcd3daecd6abddbe16299ebb189ae29ab02a2

The share price is trading where it should be... specially when you see how Apple, Googl and MSFT are already on good track with their business, generating a massive amount of cash. Zuckerberg is DESPERATE and for him this is a survival path. 

OCULUS is unique. We can't discuss this. He is leading the hardware of the METAVERSE. The issue is the software, games, education, office/work application... we still have a close to none adoption rate I'd say, that's why market is skeptic. Should we give him a chance?

&amp;#x200B;

Disclaimer: I hold a bag of 200 shares with an avg. of 160$ I beleive... This is not a financial advice, nor I know how to advice you. Just buy APPLE for the long term....I mean do your own research. Ah...I hold a bag of Apple Puts that also hurts."	0.63	9	0	9	chart	2022-10-29T23:34:00Z	ygtzf4	t3

2. Skyrocketing prices for grain based foods
3. Intervention by U.N. Allies; potentially military, or cyber interventions
4. Additional sanctions on Russia

Compounding this, is the Mississippi is suffering from devastating drought. As a result some barges are unable to ship harvested grain from north to south (not to mention petroleum based products). These two commodities make up a fair proportion of barge cargo on the Mississippi.

CCP will try to invade Taiwan within the next 24 months. Either directly or in directly by way of military force. CCP will mess with Tesla production in china by pushing their home grow EV’s or as drastically as taking over Tesla production plant and technology….Elon will start to panic, he will advocate for CCP peace meal by using twitter platform for the west not to intervene in china’s aggression. 

Back to the Ruskies: Elon is attempting to play both sides right now. He sees Russia as a major market for Tesla vehicles but also for the raw materials for batteries. Why do you think he’s trying to play both sides asking for Ukraine to accept Russians demand of signing over the land to them. 

Elon only cares about Elon. He is seeking complete dominance by pretending to care about humanity. Autocrats are his friend now. No democracy will play hiss bullshiit games. Why do you think drumpt has tried to make friendship with NK, Russkies, etc…

Tesla will be facing major competition in the EV space in the next 2-3 losing market space to VW, F, and GM. Elon will transform into a lunatic billionaire pushing his agenda against any other human rights violation. 

TLDR; Elon the welfare queen has built an empire by using the left and now using the right. Tax subsidies and tax avoidance is Elon’s strategy followed by sucking up to autocrats for Tesla gains by means of human loses.

SPY opened at that 380 range and held (important level to hold as noted in last post). It started its first leg. It came back down to 380.96 at around 8:12 UTC-6 and tested 20 MA and AVWAP. It bounced and continued upward, completing another leg and half or so. For the next hour and half, SPY traded in a large flat top triangle - getting three bounces off the 385.04 line on the scalping chart. SPY broke out of the triangle at 10:15 UTC-6 and backtested twice. The 388.96 full measured move was hit EOD. SPY continued it’s uptrend and traded in a rectangle from 11:10 UTC-6 to 12:32 UTC-6. It broke out and hit 388.96 full measured move EOD. We closed right around 389.34 line on scalping chart.

I found some time to trade in the AM before I went golfing. I took four trades. I played the second leg of the uptrend.

I played the breakout of rectangle to half measured move. It took two attempts for me as I was stopped out on the first try.

I re-entered on backtest for a tiny scalp back to half measure and called it a day

# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

US stocks ended a volatile week with a sizable gain as Apple's earnings report boosted technology shares and a smattering of economic data suggested the Federal Reserve is making some progress in its battle against inflation.

  
The S&amp;P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 both posted their longest weekly gains since August. Gains in major technology companies such as Microsoft and Google Parent Alphabet aided both indexes in reversing a two-day decline.

  
Treasuries fell on Friday, snapping a three-day rally, as hopes of a Fed pivot faded. The dollar rose for the second day in a row.

  
This week, stocks, bonds, and the dollar swung wildly as investors tried to make sense of conflicting earnings reports and economic data.

  
Quarterly reports from megacap tech names underscored the impact of the Fed’s tightening regime, and consequently the surging dollar.

  
Meanwhile, a core measure of US inflation increased in September, strengthening the Fed's case for another jumbo rate hike next week. However, a contraction in manufacturing and services, as well as lower-than-expected US home sales, indicated that the Fed's actions were already having an impact on the economy. The release of gross domestic product data on Thursday temporarily allayed fears of a recession.

  
Economists continue to expect the Fed to raise interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point next week, for the fourth time in a row. Rates are expected to rise another half point in December, followed by quarter point increases in the next two meetings.

## 65 min. Chart

* Starting to see SPY turn over a little bit - notice the rounding top trying to form. If 390 holds as resistance on Monday, I’ll be looking for 387.32 - 385.00.
* If we gap up to 395 ish and top of resistance, I’ll be looking to fade to 390.
* If we gap down to 385 ish, Ill be looking to see if 385 holds, and play either way - calls to 390 - 395 or puts to 381.50 - 379.16 - 377.00

## Trend-based Extension

* 1.618 golden ratio puts us at 407.68
* 20 MA currently at 410.35
* If the trend continues, this range is where I’d start looking for a top.

(a)(1) The Congress finds that—
(A) The **prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions**, including the transfer of record ownership and the safeguarding of securities and funds related thereto, are necessary for the protection of investors and persons facilitating transactions by and acting on behalf of investors.

(a)(2)(A) The Commission is directed, therefore, having due *regard* for the public interest, the protection of investors, the safeguarding of securities and funds, and maintenance of fair competition among brokers and dealers, clearing agencies, and transfer agents, to use its authority under this title—
(i) to facilitate the establishment of a national system for the **prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of transactions in securities**

(b)(3) A clearing agency shall not be registered unless the Commission determines that—

(A) Such clearing agency is so organized and has the capacity to be able to **facilitate the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions and derivative agreements, contracts, and transactions for which it is responsible**, to safeguard securities and funds in its custody or control or for which it is responsible, to comply with the provisions of this title and the rules and regulations thereunder

(F) The **rules of the clearing agency are designed to promote the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions** and, to the extent applicable, derivative agreements, contracts, and transactions, to assure the safeguarding of securities and funds which are in the custody or control of the clearing agency or for which it is responsible, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in the clearance and settlement of securities transactions, to **remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a national system for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions**, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest

(G) The rules of the clearing agency provide that its participants shall be appropriately disciplined for violation of any provision of the rules of the clearing agency by expulsion, suspension, limitation of activities, functions, and operations, fine, censure, or any other fitting sanction.

(b)(5)(C) A registered clearing agency may summarily **suspend and close the accounts of a participant who** (i) has been and is expelled or suspended from any self-regulatory organization, (ii) **is in default of any delivery of** funds or **securities to the clearing agency**, or (iii) is in such financial or operating difficulty that the clearing agency determines and so **notifies the appropriate regulatory agency** for such participant that such suspension and closing of accounts are necessary for the protection of the clearing agency, its participants, creditors, or investors.

TLDR: SEC is responsible for ensuring clearing agencies, and therefore parties participating in said clearing agencies, never Fail To Deliver (FTD) securities. SEC data from second-half of September 2022 shows 2,687,705,568 FTDs of 68,260 tickers. Yes that’s 2.6 BILLION shares that where **NOT prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions** and the SEC not only has the data but manages the publishing of it.

wallstreetbets	Nearby-Ad-2058	self.wallstreetbets	8	A deep dive look into Meta Income Statement as well as what their EPS might look like without reality labs	"The 4th picture will show you what their EPS would look like if we take out reality labs. I will however go through the other 3 pictures to explain the current situation

[Meta analysis 1](https://imgur.com/CRnf0I4)

Meta revenue came in -4.5% lower than the sept 2021 same quarter. As you can see, in 2021, for every 1 dollar of revenue, 64 cents was going to costs. In 2022, for every 1 dollar of revenue, 80 cents is going to cost. We're seeing a 45.66% decline in operating income. Also they are paying 21.18% in taxes which we will use later in our picture 4 calculation.

[Meta analysis 2](https://imgur.com/Qk325WQ)

In the 2021 quarter, eps came in at 3.22 and in the 2022 quarter, eps came in at 1.64. That is essentially a 49% drop. If we're looking at diluted shares outstanding, the number declined by 6% meaning they are outpacing stock based compensation with their buyback program. Their total share based comp expense has increased 31.74% which is understandable given they are growing a new revenue segment

[Meta Analysis 3](https://imgur.com/IUKfISN)

The information here shows the revenue segments and as we can see, from the 2021 quarter to the 2022 quarter, reality labs revenue dropped by 48.92% and the family of apps revenue dropped by 3.6%. Given that reality labs is the segment they are pouring money into, this is highly unwelcoming news. This quarters loss on the reality labs segment also came in significantly higher and compared to 2021 quarter, was 39.57% higher.

[Meta Analysis 4](https://imgur.com/GAb3pG9)

Now if we remove reality labs, EPS would come in around 2.71 versus the 1.64 we got.  That is a 65.24% increase on EPS. Keep in mind that there are shared expenses and getting rid of a segment may not be as oversimplified as I have shown here.

Hope you enjoyed the post and would love to hear any additional insight."	0.73	5	0	5	dd	2022-10-29T06:24:29Z	yg8o50	t3

The company recently teamed up with Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc.'s (OTC: ANCTF) Circle K Stores, an American chain of convenience stores, to sell licensed cannabis at Circle K gasoline retailers in Florida.

However, Florida Health Department told the Washington Examiner that state regulators have not approved the deal.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dfq0jemwqmw91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ad5962cd5b3280cbbd7c5205f5bd58426fcdee4

**Risk management/ Stop losses** 

The answer sadly was right in front of me the whole time… risk management. I am someone that preaches and preaches risk management and small gains till im blue in my server. However, I failed to practice what I preached. 

Lets take a look at the win % of July and August 71.76% vs. my current 84.16% win rate currently. Yes a 84.16% win rates impressive in my opinion but with my strategy I can and should be profitable with a 71.76% win rate? So why was I note profitable? Lets take a look at a few weeks of trades and its pretty easy to see why. 

Note- for those of you who question why I use excel to show my losses/ wins this is why cause I can analyze things in a way that TOS does not let me. 

Now what do you see? In terms of stop losses there were no stop losses. I thought I was smarter then the chart. I thought that I just got a bad bounce and it would come back to me. What I ended up doing was putting myself in such a whole that I couldn’t recover. 

For the week on the left had I closed stuff out at -20% I would have finished the week at +$1974 and on the right I would have closed the week at $1890. Same win rate… but completely different result… So not even changing the loss from a win BUT changing where I close out my loss (and more importantly accepting my loss at -20%) would immediately have turned two of those 6 week green (and actually would have turned every one of those 6 weeks green and even looking back from January to June I believe 90% of my weeks had I closed out at -20% on my losses… and not increased my win rate or anything else… I would have been profitable on every single week.). 

So when people ask me “what did you change?” “its impossible for someone to have 8 green weeks!” “its impossible for someone to recover like that!”

I say no its not… I say and I say this to 90% of people who blow their accounts up or have a green week go red… “where was your stop loss?”   
 

Risk management and mitigating our losses is about 100x more important then taking proifts. There are actually numerous strategies out there that can have 40-60% win rates BUT with proper stop losses can have extremely profitable results. 

There is a rule called the 10/20 rules… the goal should be 10% profits and we should use a HARD -20% stop loss. We can not think about it and we can not try to out smart it. This is another reason I stopped playing 0dte lottos as they would result in -90% losses I could recover. 

Honestly I could stop right here but there is a few other minor things that have helped me.

**Position sizing**

I have talked about this since forever but I always say that your options account should be 10% of your total investment portfolio. That means if you have $10,000 to invest (for simple numbers) you should really only have about $1000 in your options account. And of that 10% you should only be trading with at MOST 10% of the 10%. That means each position size should only be about $100. 

Why? Why so small? We have to assume the worst. If we use $100/ trade on a cash only account (which if you haven’t switched to a cash only account SWITCH NOW!) then we can make about 10 trades per day. That means with the 10/20 rule and about a 70%-80% win rate we can remain profitable every day. Its about quality quantity not one quality trade. This is a mistake I made in July and August also. 

I was so focused on making one good trade that I would end up making a bad trade or wait so long to enter that I would get stopped out immediately. 

Something I did and HIGHLY recommend people do is to size heavily down in times of bad trading… when I recognized in June and July that I was struggling I sized down by 1/5th per trade. And then I sized down another ½ in the really bad times. From there focusing on the % gains not the $ gained I was able to gather myself and now I have gone from $500/ trade to $1000/ trade to $1500/ trade and now im pretty content at about $2000-$2500 per trade and I don’t think I will size up again for a while. Maybe another month or so of consistency and I will size back up. 

The number one goal should always be capital preservation. Remember the light at the end of the tunnel is the end of this bear market and a return to the “easy” times of a bull market. 

**Win rate doesn’t= profit** 

This is something I wish I would have taken to heart even earlier then I did. I had a really respected trader tell me this all the time when I was so proud of my 80% win rate. But he reminded me (and so did my weekly log) that win rate doesn’t equal profitable. There are actually a lot of strats out there where you can be holding a 40-60% win rate and still make money. This plays into the first and most important point of all of this… STOP LOSSES ARE KING. 

**Trusting myself**

This is the last point I want to make. In this market we have to trust ourselves and have confidence in our trades. Something that I experienced in this bear market for the first time was lack of confidence in myself. There was so many times where I would enter a trade (back before my hard set stop loss days) and I would get a rogue $3 green candle (like we saw this week) that would wreck my position beyond belief. I would finally take my loss and then we would see some wild bounce $6 the other way back in my favor. Where had I just held I would end up green. 

This is where this 2022 market is absolutely brutal and I have seen some pretty decent traders wash themselves out of this market. When we lose confidence in ourselves we lose confidence in the plays we make. I struggled with this (and honestly some of it was pressure on myself to be perfect and to never lose cause of the server and I have a lot of eyes on me). But I know im not perfect and I know no matter how perfect a setup works in the end we will never win everytime. Sure it was fun when I had like a 35 green trades in a row win streak but honestly it was just luck. 

What I have learned is when we recognize a trend we do not fight momentum nor do we fight the trend. BUT it is okay to say I don’t like this setup, I don’t like this day, or this isn’t my ideal setup and to sit cash gang. There are so many people who fail to understand the importance of the fact that cash IS a position. You cant lose money sitting cash. WAIT for YOUR setup to come to you. 

Another thing I struggled with for a while was traders paralysis. I had so many things I was waiting to be “perfect” before I entered a trade that by time the crystals would align I would have missed the move already. This plays into my last and final point. 

**Aggressive without being wreckless**

Speaking of trader paralysis what I found is that in waiting for everything to be perfect by time I got into the trade that initial little pop that gets you that 10% in 30 seconds had already pasted and I was left with the bread crumbs of bread crumbs waiting for the 10% pop that never came. 

I found that through those red weeks and endless days and weekends backtesting and backtesting and backtesting I found what works for me. What is the post HIGH PROBABILITY risk to reward plays. In my server often times you’’ll hear me play these “bounce or die” or “die or bounce” plays. 

That is what I mean about high probability plays. Often times these are when the indicators are favoring lets say a call and SPY 15min chart has retraced to a key support and is sitting on it. Everything points to a bounce back up but its not perfect yet. 

I would rather take a play that has a high probability of success then wait so long for confirmation that I end up never seeing profits. I trade a fine line between aggressive and wreckless. With the 10/20 rule a 0dte gives you enough wiggle room to be slightly off on timing with being aggressive BUT if you are too aggressive (aka wreckless) then you end up just stopping out and then it plays out how you expected. 

I hope this helps you guys if you have any questions let me know!"	0.8	45	0	45	question	2022-10-29T02:19:56Z	yg3o0m	t3

All chip companies were expecting to have a much lower EPS, but Intel surprised us with a 73% beat. What does that mean for the future earnings reports coming? AMD has been struggling just like the rest of the semiconductors (definitely a bit more), but I wonder if tech will rally regardless of the results just because of how low it is this year already.

wallstreetbets	DaddyDersch	self.wallstreetbets	33	10-28-22 SPY/ ES Futures, Apple and Tesla Weekly Analysis and Recap (and how i went from 2 red months to 2 green months in a row)	"Is anyone else having major déjà vu or is it just me? Lets flash back to last Friday… The beginning of of the week had a nice green two days followed by a doji Wednesday and a hammer candle on Thursday. This hammer candle showed downside potential and after hours did too. Then Friday came and out of no where ripped a 2.45% green day… Flash forward to this week its nearly an identical movement. I mean 100% identical. Scary at best. 

Today I am not too proud to admit I misplayed 100% and I unknowingly was far to bearish and bet against the markets. The worst part is… I even called this weekly rally last week in my weekly TA.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/a3a56ccw7mw91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f85daeb5ea4b1cf9f4dac4f908e24f3738ffc38

Guess I should trust myself a little more huh? I definitely got blinded by the big tech earning misses, GDP coming in hot af, PCE/ PMI, job claims, etc etc etc. all of that was bearish af for the week. But what happened? Market didn’t care… why? Because the markets still believe JPOW is going to say on Wednesday at 230pm for FOMC (stay tuned this weekend I will release the FOMC trading plan to the server) that “we have inflation under control or we don’t wanna over shoot on rate hikes so we will look to slow down our hikes in December.”

This is why we are rallying in my opinion. 

So where does this leave us next week… well this is the scenarios I forsee. 

Monday and Tuesday I have pinned for a bullish because we really don’t have anything on the books negative wise. I don’t forsee anything economic or macro wise to really bring us down and its pretty clear by this weeks movements and recovery that bulls are in control and the markets is not going to sell off (I misplayed that today). 

Wednesday is FOMC day… I expect a green day. Now the question will be does JPOW rightfully say “we have not controlled inflation and while we do not want to overshoot rate hikes we need to slow inflation first” if he says this then we should look for a dump into CPI. However, if he says “I believe inflation is tamed and we will see the effects of that on the next CPI and going forward and that should allow us to slow our rate hikes… slow not pause…” we are going to rally. 

From there I honestly don’t forsee CPI coming in as a beat at all.. it actually is going to probably be a huge miss… if you remember back in August when CPI came in hot they held off on releasing the consensus (just like now) until we got very close to CPI… I have a feeling after or the day of FOMC we will see the consensus finally released. Which will allow me to accurately predict next CPI…   
 

Regardless of whether we rally or dump after FOMC I expect us to get a bad CPI reading and I will be looking for a repeat of August. What I think is happening is a tactful unwinding of the VIX prior to FOMC and CPI to avoid the crash once again. It seems like this is the general strategy that has happened time and time again. We get these rallies through bad news, and every dip is a buying opportunity where the technical make zero sense (such as this morning where VOLD was extreme bearish and nearly extreme bearish however we saw markets continue to rip). 

In short im bullish till Wednesday then we will take it from there… 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/01m9slj18mw91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f5350bfd176464416e90563b10fc4bd5ea7f493

In short SPY has maintained this red bull channel for 2 weeks now and until I see this bull channel broken I will remain bullish. I am seeing today we made a really nice double bottom off 379.8 which also was a daily 8ema support test and hold (this is the big play I over looked today with my bearish bias). In addition we put in a 2 day (almost 3) bullish engulfing daily candle. With maintaining and holding within this green channel and failing to retrace through it I am seeing that a 390.1 resistance test will be coming on Monday. The question is do we level up and push for the 400s before FOMC or do we reject that 390 level Monday and actually spend some time consolidating before FOMC. 

Fun note- this week is now the only the 2nd time this year that markets have put in a green week the week before FOMC the other time was July. 

If and when we break through 390 then I will be looking as the 50% retracement line of the bear channel and start eyeing 405.1 as next level resistance. I am not quite convinced that we will have the steam to get there but I do think we could take 395-400 before FOMC or on FOMC day (if jpow is bullish). 

However, if Monday we reject 390.1 channel resistance I would look for this red bull channel support to be tested and see if that 380 support holds. The one thing to note is that this is the first time a candle has closed over 388.6 since September 22nd. 

&amp;#x200B;

Funny enough about this weekly candle is that this candle last night was showing a 100% different story. However, todays candle is our 2nd green week in a row and our first back to back green weeks since August. With this candle I look for continuation, however, we did fall just short of breaking through the weekly 20ema. We will need to take that level out then we can start looking at that next major level resistance of 408.9. 

If we double top of the weekly 20ema we could see a retracement back to that 375.6 weekly level. 

Key support- 385.2 -&gt; 375.6 -&gt; 363.7

Key resistance- 390 -&gt; 399.8 -&gt; 409.9

&amp;#x200B;

Futures put in a massive green day today and dead ended right at that 3925 level which just so happens to be its daily 100ema. On the bullish side of things you can see we held the daily 8ema as support today, reconfirmed 3800 as support and broke through the bear channel from August. There is no longer (besides the 2022 bear channel resistance) downward resistance to watch for. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fscdh1z28mw91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e808dce0070bfd9ff8ae8db162339380956d5f3

Futures actually was able to close over the weekly 20ema. However, as you can see it fell just short of breaking through the orange channel level resistance of 3925. Next week we will look for futures to turn 3925 into support which should open up an opportunity for futes to test next level resistance around 4085. 

Key support- 3870 -&gt; 3770 -&gt; 3705

Key resistance- 3925 -&gt; 4005 -&gt; 4085

&amp;#x200B;

Apple put in one hell of an impressive day today making a total intraday movement of $9.68 which was 179% of its 10day average range. It also put in 175% of its 30day average volume today. People poured into Apple today. I think people found their “safe haven.”

Apple actually broke through its bull channels resistance and topped out right at 157.5 resistance today. With that being where apple hit and retraced we will look for that as key resistance to break over next week. 

This is the first time Apple has closed over the 8, 20, 50, 100 and 200 ema since September 12th. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w10vo4448mw91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bedfeababdc8a92d237b080c4c7d3c42cb2bb432

Apple weekly played perfectly off the levels… for those who say TA don’t work or that you cant TA stuff when its parabolic… today even on a ridiculously big move Apple still respected levels. These chart levels were untouched and it closed right under that key 157.5 weekly level. 

With apple bounced off that red support line, holding 147.2 as support and closing over all the EMAs we should naturally look for some upside next week. 

Key support- 150.6 -&gt; 147.3 -&gt; 141.2

Key resistance- 155.8 -&gt; 161.2 

&amp;#x200B;

My love and hate relationship with Tesla is unmatched by anything else. Tesla provided me with 3 huge wins 3 days in a row, however, today I became too bearish and burnt myself playing some level to level plays. Now that I am being more objective I actually see a pretty bullish case for tesla next week. 

We came back down and tested the daily 8ema and managed to close back over that. However, we did fall just short of 230 resistance and the daily 20ema resistance. Tesla looked like it had no sense of direction today and that could have possibly been related to the twitter deal being completed today. 

With this hanging man candle on the daily I am looking for a repeat of 10/24/22 and will look to see a bigger push up on Tesla Monday/ next week. We are right at key resistance for the blue bear channel which lies at 228 for Monday. 

There is a case to be made as I mentioned earlier this week that tesla is establishing a consolidation channel from 205 to 230 and honestly until we close over 230 we haven’t officially broken that trend yet. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xko3nh458mw91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f20046ac91fcc7fe9e9798bbbaff7caa08d2f411

Tesla still has a daily and weekly gap at 262.47 to fill. I don’t forsee that filling next week but with a bullish enough sentiment and bullish enough FOMC its not out of the realm of possibilities. Bulls are not trading back over the weekly 50% bear channel retracement mark and will look to turn 2330 turn into support next week. 

Support -204.5 -&gt; 191.7

Resistance- 245 -&gt; 254.7

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yo1vk3468mw91.png?width=612&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db48cfdd4f1612477263cfb79af75400fd903960

As I had mentioned I do believe we are seeing the VIX being unwound before FOMC and next CPI. Its generally bad juju to have it over 30 before such events happen. With us clearly trading under the key 28.4 and now under 27 I will look for a the VIX to be near 23.6 to 24.7 before FOMC on Wednesday. 

10% challenge- 

Overall despite finishing green today (bless up tesla) today was not a great day for me. I was too biased bearish and I couldn’t get a read on the technical today. VOLD (difference of buy/ sell on NYSE) is one of my biggest indicators and biggest check boxes for entering a trade. Today until about 1145am VOLD was not supporting any sort of rallying. IT actually was showing that a huge sell off should have occurred. This also put me overly bearish, however, the charge was led by SPY and tech today and by mid day NYSE jumped on board finally. From there I still took every rejection (consolidation) at key levels as a short opportunity and ended up missing out on some good bull plays. 

Cant win them all and no ones perfect but I look forward to a good weekend to reset my head and trade better next week. This has been a pretty tough 3 days to trade in my opinion. Monday and Tuesday were great though thankfully. 

My Apple put was toasted at open but took a nice win on that Amazon earnings play at open to recoup most of the loss… apparently I shoulda gone even more OTM as one of the 80s puts on Amazon paid 1k%+ at open. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was able to record my most profitable week in two months and my most profitable week of the year. Which actually is more impressive being that im trading with ½ the position size still that I traded with from January to May. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zjbfyw778mw91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=268d69cba133de42788c6104e5d15e0c9b185ae1

I have gotten a lot of questions of “how did you go from 6 out of 8 weeks being red to 8 green weeks in a row? “How is it even possible to go from losing that much to winning like this now?” 

The answer sadly was right in front of me the whole time… risk management. I am someone that preaches and preaches risk management and small gains till im blue in my server. However, I failed to practice what I preached. 

Lets take a look at the win % of July and August 71.76% vs. my current 84.16% win rate currently. Yes a 84.16% win rates impressive in my opinion but with my strategy I can and should be profitable with a 71.76% win rate? So why was I note profitable? Lets take a look at a few weeks of trades and its pretty easy to see why. 

Note- for those of you who question why I use excel to show my losses/ wins this is why cause I can analyze things in a way that TOS does not let me. 

Now what do you see? In terms of stop losses there were no stop losses. I thought I was smarter then the chart. I thought that I just got a bad bounce and it would come back to me. What I ended up doing was putting myself in such a whole that I couldn’t recover. 

For the week on the left had I closed stuff out at -20% I would have finished the week at +$1974 and on the right I would have closed the week at $1890. Same win rate… but completely different result… So not even changing the loss from a win BUT changing where I close out my loss (and more importantly accepting my loss at -20%) would immediately have turned two of those 6 week green (and actually would have turned every one of those 6 weeks green and even looking back from January to June I believe 90% of my weeks had I closed out at -20% on my losses… and not increased my win rate or anything else… I would have been profitable on every single week.). 

So when people ask me “what did you change?” “its impossible for someone to have 8 green weeks!” “its impossible for someone to recover like that!”

I say no its not… I say and I say this to 90% of people who blow their accounts up or have a green week go red… “where was your stop loss?”   
 

Risk management and mitigating our losses is about 100x more important then taking proifts. There are actually numerous strategies out there that can have 40-60% win rates BUT with proper stop losses can have extremely profitable results. 

There is a rule called the 10/20 rules… the goal should be 10% profits and we should use a HARD -20% stop loss. We can not think about it and we can not try to out smart it. This is another reason I stopped playing 0dte lottos as they would result in -90% losses I could recover. 

I will make this into a dedicated reddit post and mention a few other things later too but wanted to bring this up here too!

wallstreetbets	TheGoatBet	self.wallstreetbets	98	Inflation! Also known as corporate greed via price gouging!	" 

Exxon Mobile recently revealed record gross (25%) and net (10.7%) profit margins for Q3 2022.

Q4 2020 was their lowest margins of all time at 17% gross and **-12.4%** net (yes negative net margin).

It's incredibly obvious that energy companies are not raising rates due to inflation but rather to price gouge consumers to make up for their lack of profit from Q4 2020 to Q3 2021.

But wait, it gets better! A metric called Free Cash Flow represents the amount of cash a business has on hand to pay dividends, interest to investors or repay creditors (or do anything else they want).

In Q4202 Exxon Mobile had **-$2.6B** in FCF. Today they have a positive $49.3B in FCF with $39.5B in long term debt (a $12.8B decline year over year).

So what does that mean? Exxon could pay off **all** of their long term debt and still have nearly $10 BILLION DOLLARS in the bank.

So just remember while nearly every human on Earth was struggling financially and emotionally during the pandemic... Exxon has been capitating from the ""Blame it on inflation"" excuse like **every other business** to achieve all time high profit margins which are currently up 46.3% since Dec 31, 2020.

When's the last time you got a 46% raise in 2 years?

But yeah ""inflation"" ...  

TLDR: record margin year, reversion to the mean, lower profit in future. Long poots.

wallstreetbets	JohnniePeters	self.wallstreetbets	24	Stock: CD Projekt Red (CPR) - from games like The Witcher and Cyberpunk	"CD Project Red (CDR). For those who don't know, this is a Polish game developer. Mainly known from The Witcher series and Cyberpunk 2077.

The Witcher 3 in particular was a huge success with over 40 million copies sold!

After a disastrous start of the game 'Cyberpunk 2077' in 2020, the stock has since gone into free fall and this was very deserved. The stock fell from €104,- in Dec. 2020 to €17,- on September 1, 2022. From this point on, the stock rose to €26,- today, and this was all due to the new announcements about 4 weeks ago.

But the game Cyberpunk has also made a big comeback. It broke record after record in recent weeks and months and has already sold more than 20 million times. There will also be a free DLC (Downloadable Content) for this game in 2023.

Why I am very bullish on this stock:

\* The Witcher 3 was a huge success, however only 10% of players have also played The Witcher 1, which came out in 2007. I expect the upcoming remake (Canis Majoris) to be widely sold among fans of The Witcher 3, but also to new players.

\* Due to the enormous success of The Witcher 3, it is very likely that the new 3-part series of games (Polaris) will sell extremely well. In addition, all 3 games in that series will be released within 6 years, at least that is the intention and realistically this can be very likely (The games are made in Unreal Engine 5)

\* The new standalone of The Witcher (Sirius) will undoubtedly reach the hardcore fans, but may also attract new fans who are more focused on multiplayer.

\* Completely new IP! (Hadar) I expect a huge hype. A hype that will be fulfilled. One has learned from the Cyberpunk release is my view. And the strong comeback of Cyberpunk 2077 seems to restore buyer confidence.

\* The new Cyberpunk (Orion) game. Because the first game (Cyberpunk 2077) has made a strong comeback, and has even completely silenced all criticism from 2 years ago, this game will be sold enormously. A new fan base has been tapped, because in essence it is a completely different world than the one of The Witcher. This game will also be developed in Unreal Engine 5 and it is expected that the controls of vehicles in particular will feel much more real and smoother. Cyberpunk's current sales and the 180-degree twisted sentiment surrounding that game portend that Orion has a grandiose future.

Overall, I believe the price of this stock is deeply undervalued. No guarantees.

I don’t have a single stock. However, on monday it will be the first thing I’m going to do.

Made an ER play and didn’t expect a -20% dump.  Taking assignment because this piece of shit isn’t getting back to $115 any time soon so I’ll be selling CC’s below my cost basis to generate more cash and if they get called away, IDGAF because at least I’ll have made a little bit back instead of taking the L now or rolling only to take it later.

Ended the month with +$2500 in cash after servicing debt so November loan payment is already on the books giving me a little more run way on this shit META position.  Maybe I can ask for Zuck to pull back on this Metaverse bullshit at least a little bit for Christmas?

Anyway, here are the ledgers

wallstreetbets	predictany007	self.wallstreetbets	20	Elon Musk’s first day owning Twitter leads to havoc and a possible hoax about layoffs	"On Elon Musk’s first day in control of Twitter, a person who walked out of the company’s San Francisco headquarters and identified themselves as a data engineer there said they were just laid off. CNBC was not able to immediately verify the identity of that person and one other who made a similar claim.

One employee at Twitter, awaiting information about layoffs or projects, told CNBC they were in the dark for the most part. Musk was meeting with relatively low-ranking engineering managers, this person noted —a welcome gesture to some. Press reports before the deal closed said that Musk had planned cuts as deep as 75% of headcount.

Twitter did not respond to repeated requests for comment about layoffs.

Musk finally took over the company on Thursday, ending a months-long legal saga. The billionaire Tesla and SpaceX CEO initially agreed to buy the company for $44 billion, but soon after tried to get out of the deal because he claimed Twitter was not forthcoming enough about spam accounts on the platform. Twitter has denied that and went to court to try to get Musk to complete the deal.

Prior to the original trial date earlier this month, Musk agreed once again to close the deal. The judge gave Musk until Friday at 5 p.m. to close the deal, or else set a new trial date.

On Thursday, several top executives departed the company, including CEO Parag Agrawal and CFO Ned Segal, CNBC’s David Faber reported. Twitter’s head of legal policy, trust and safety Vijaya Gadde was also fired.

wallstreetbets	largefriesandashake	self.wallstreetbets	115	What the boomer idiot investors don't realize about METAverse	"I see some real shit opinions all over Reddit on META, as this place has somehow become a cynical cesspool of anti-intellectual teenagers that think they know better. 

Listen to me instead. An elder millennial that gets triggered by misinformation all day long and also thinks I know better. (sometimes it's even true) Also, may or may not be regarded. You tell me. 

Here's what I see:

\&gt;""it looks worse than roblox / vr chat"" 

\&gt;""Facebook is dying""

\&gt;""bring back myspace""

First of all, shut the fuck up. Just stop. Please. It hurts my head. If it was true, that would be fine. But like I said I my autism gets triggered by dumbness. 

WHY has Facebook/META thrown nearly 100 billion at this? (with a revenue of 27 billion per quarter, they have the money)

Facebook is the ONLY multi-modal social media company in the USA. It has a marketplace, local community groups, videos (50% of all facebook traffic is watching videos) not to mention Insta, whatsapp. You can do almost anything on it. Run a business. Chat with your mom. See what your friends are doing. Rent a boat. Harass women with pics of your extremely small penis. Whatever you want! (don't do the last one bro. Just don't.)

So WHY? 

It's a hardware platform, that you cannot access on a normal PC. Only on a META VR headset (potentially) 

You think the graphics look bad? That's like blaming youtube for 480p video. Don't blame youtube. Blame the creator for having a shitty camera. Metaverse is the platform. Not the video. It's a new platform that has tools to do whatever you want. AR or VR both in one.

Now just imagine this, if you can. Tell your wife to hop off her boyfriend's dick, pull both of them over, and try to imagine with me. 

Your favorite youtube/twitch livestreamer? Don't watch them anymore. VR with them. Walk in their room as they talk to you. Sit at their desk. You're not behind a screen anymore. You're in the room. Even a prerecorded youtube video can work this way. Or do it live.

You want to see that Ye redemption concert tour but the tickets are $5,000? Attend in VR. Walk around, live. The performer doesn't need a headset. Just you. Interact with other VR people at the concert (or not). See their facial expressions. Dance with them. Switch your headset over to AR, go to the fridge, get a drink, check your texts, reply to an email, and then head back into the concert. All using the headset. Buy merch at the shop, which has an AR eshop overlay. Easy. This can be done with 3d camera arrays. Even a basic iphone can LIDAR scan a bedroom in 5 minutes. Apple ahead of the game as always. A highly accurate (to the 1/16"" accuracy) venue model can be recreated in a single day using current technology, like the Leica BLK360 scanner. That's your metaverse. It's whatever you want. 

You can't attend your best friends wedding? Attend in VR metaverse platform. The normal attendees will just see you on a screen (or not at all), they don't need headsets. But you can walk around, see the moment, while not being too invasive. To them, you're just on an ipad somewhere. Maybe there's a few 360 cameras around. Some LIDAR scanners to record the venue (or the venue provides this). You're not intrusive, but you can experience it. 

Want to buy a puppy on FB marketplace? See it in VR. Live. Confirm it's not a scam. Send the money through Facebook even, with buyer protection.

Onlyfans - see your favorite porn model from every angle. Walk around. Jack off in the privacy of your home. Squirt some e-jizz all over his/her face. or not. I'm not the boss of you.

The possibilities here are endless. This hasn't even mentioned the work from home benefits yet. This is still 5-10 years down the road. But it is coming. Reality and the digital world WILL mix together more and more over time. Unless the apocalypse gets us first ofc. And META has a huge head start in technology hardware and software tools (not software environment))

So. That's why you're all dumb for comparing it to VR chat. Thanks for coming to my ted talk.

I sold my calls yesterday, but I plan on going back in next week on Jan 100c contracts.

**2. 3/15/2020 - 3/16/2020**

**3. Bulls and Bears Battle it Out**Volume spikes as bulls buy on hope and covering, and bears sell on pessimism. 4. As the new reality starts to sink in on the market, panic subsides and volume starts to fall.

Volume rises as fears over covid grow. Notice how panic selling is associated with spikes in volume. 2. Panic buying can also cause panic selling. It's not unusual to get your highest volume days where the price is flat. I suspect this is because people are disagreeing about how to interpret the news. My guess is that in February, hockey puck candles with large volume represent uncertainty. I think the volume represents this process happening over and over:

1. Someone bearish because of COVID sells
2. Someone who thinks covid isn't a big deal buys because ""COVID isn't a big deal, and the market will bounce back"".
3. Someone who was bearish and missed their chance to sell at this price level finally caves and sells their shares
4. Someone who thinks covid is a big deal, and therefore counts on government intervention buys
5. Cycle back to the bear selling until closing.
6. In the end, you have a reason for both bulls and bears to buy and sell to each other, and you get a huge spike in volume
7. Candles flatten out and the volume starts to fall, I suspect because bulls and bears have largely positioned themselves already. There's no reason for either group to buy or sell at this point.
8. Volume picks up as the pandemic reveals itself to a threat to the economy.
9. The end of the COVID market panic winds down as volume falls."	0.67	2	0	2	question	2022-10-28T20:13:50Z	yfuin8	t3

* Apple stock surges, on pace for its best day since 2020
* Apple stock rose over 7% on Friday after reporting September quarter earnings that modestly beat expectations on revenue and profit and showed global demand for its premium hardware remains high.
* “Sometimes in-line results are most exciting,” wrote JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee in a note on Friday.

Apple stock rose over 7% on Friday after reporting September quarter earnings that modestly beat expectations on revenue and profit and showed global demand for its premium hardware remains high.

If it holds until the close, it’ll be the best day for Apple shares since April 2020. Apple was the second-best-performing stock in the Dow Jones behind Intel on Friday.

The surge comes after a mixed week of Big Tech earnings, in which Meta and Alphabet

showed signs of weakness caused by macroeconomic conditions hurting the digital ad market. Alphabet rose less than 3% and Meta was up less than 1%.on Friday. Both took big hits earlier in the week.

Amazon fell 9% on Friday after giving weak guidance for the holiday quarter.

Although Apple signaled some slowing growth in the current quarter, and weakness in its profitable service business, analysts were generally positive about the company’s results.

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Dozens of equity cannabis licensees and applicants from New Jersey and New York sent a letter to Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) today demanding that the United States Senate bring the Secure and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act for a floor vote to lift the federal ban that prohibits financial institutions from servicing cannabis businesses.

wallstreetbets	predictany007	self.wallstreetbets	18	Twitter will be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange on November 8	"Twitter’s stock will be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange on November 8, according to a new filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. This comes a day after Elon Musk completed the company’s takeover after a lengthy ordeal late Thursday. Incidentally, the delisting is taking place on the same date as the U.S. midterm elections.

“The New York Stock Exchange hereby notifies the SEC of its intention to remove the entire class of the stated securities from listing and registration on the Exchange at the opening of business on November 08, 2022, pursuant to the provisions of Rule 12d2-2 (a),” the filing reads.

It also indicated that the merger between Twitter and Musk’s subsidiary X Holdings II, Inc was complete. Musk’s X Holdings I, Inc. will now own all the stock of the social network.

wallstreetbets	werenotthatcool	self.wallstreetbets	2	Missing Barrels	"Statisticians and data collectors, with every supply and demand report for US oil, are forced to contend with a line item known as ""adjustments"" or ""miscellaneous to balance"". Industry participants know this line item as the ""missing barrels"" row. Most years this makes up only a small part of the overall supply/demand picture, but recently this number has been growing to record proportions of the overall report. Here's a quote from Bloomberg's ""Elements"" newsletter explaining the scale of these ghost barrels in more detail.

""Typically, the adjustment factor is relatively small, perhaps 1% of  total demand. But earlier this week, the US Energy Information  Administration, a government agency, said it couldn't properly identify a  record 2.26 million barrels per day of oil -- equivalent to nearly 11%  of the country's consumption. To put the number into perspective, if the  EIA ""adjustment"" line was a country, it would roughly equal  the daily  oil consumption of Germany."" --*Javier Blas; Bloomberg Elements*

The problem began growing in 2016 when the US lifted oil export restrictions and domestic production began to increase significantly. It has led to baseless conspiracy theories that the EIA has become a political tool for helping the white house. I receive many of the EIA reports directly to my email, and I can tell you that they put together the most comprehensive regional/ national energy statistics in the world. The missing barrels problem, however, seems to be growing out of control and needs to be quickly addressed.

""In July, the most recent month available, the adjustment factor climbed  to 1.1 million barrels -- or about 10 times the average from 1973 to  2021."" --*Javier Blas; Bloomberg Elements*"	0.63	2	0	2	question	2022-10-28T18:20:22Z	yfqzwb	t3

wallstreetbets	Sunsmiling	self.wallstreetbets	10	Exxon's record-smashing Q3 profit nearly matches Apple's	" 

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp on Friday smashed expectations as soaring energy prices fuelled a record-breaking quarterly profit, nearly matching that of tech giant Apple.

Its $19.66 billion third-quarter net profit far exceeded recently raised Wall Street forecasts as sky-rocketing natural gas and high oil prices put its earnings within reach of Apple's $20.7 billion net for the same period.

As recently as 2013, Exxon ranked as the largest publicly traded U.S. company by market value - a position now held by Apple.

Oil company profits have soared this year as rising demand and an under-supplied energy market collided with Western sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. U.S. exports of gas and oil to Europe have jumped and promise to set all-time profit records for the industry.

The top U.S. oil producer reported a per share profit of $4.68, exceeding Wall Street's $3.89 consensus view, on a huge jump in natural gas earnings, continued high oil prices and strong fuel sales.

Exxon, which led record gains by the five producers known as oil majors in the prior quarter, pulled far ahead of peers Shell and TotalEnergies with third-quarter profits almost twice as big. Its gains were aided by its highly criticized decision to double down on fossil fuels as European competitors shifted to renewables.

""Our investments over the past five years, including through the lows of the pandemic, are really driving our results today,"" Chief Financial Officer Kathryn Mikells told Reuters.

Exxon banked $43 billion in the first nine months of this year, 19% more than in the same period of 2008, when oil prices traded at a record level of $140 per barrel.

The company spent $5.73 billion on new oil and gas projects last quarter, up 24% from a year ago, and remains on track to hit an investment target of $21 billion to $24 billion this year, she said.

Rising profits have renewed calls by U.S. President Joe Biden for companies to invest the windfall profits from this year's energy price runup in production rather than buy back their own shares.

Exxon will maintain its $30 billion share buyback program through 2023 while increasing dividends, Mikells said. On Friday, it declared a fourth-quarter per share dividend of 91 cents, up 3 cents, and will pay $15 billion to shareholders this year.

Investors this week pushed up Exxon shares to a record intraday high of $109.58 as oil prices traded above $96 per barrel.

In the third quarter, U.S. natural gas prices averaged $7.95 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), up 10% from the second quarter. Brent prices eased to $98 per barrel in the same period, from an average of $109 between April and June.

Exxon said its oil and gas production from the Permian Basin is near 560,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed), a record. That is up 11% or 50,000 barrels per day from a year ago.

Results were helped by an almost 100,000 boed increase over the previous quarter in Guyana, where Exxon leads a consortium responsible for all output in the South American nation.

But output was hit by its withdrawal from Russia, where it abandoned more than $4 billion in assets and a 220,000 boed project following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. Exxon said its assets were expropriated.

As a result, the company reduced its production forecast for the year by about 100,000 barrels per day.

""We are going to end up at about 3.7 million barrels a day for the full year,"" Mikells said, down from a 3.8 million goal set in February."	0.75	6	0	6	question	2022-10-28T15:48:15Z	yfna3y	t3

 Its shares are down 77.1% year-to-date and 89.3% below their July 2021 all-time highs.
 Stocks are attractive after their big drop this year.
 It's been a tough year for Roku, whose shares have lost more than two-thirds of their value as macroeconomic issues worsen, including rising interest rates, rising inflation and concerns about a potential recession. .
 The ad-heavy streaming platform and hardware provider, which was one of the notable winners during the pandemic, has also been weighed down by deteriorating fundamentals, including slowing digital ad spending, the supply chain, as well as increased competition from other streaming companies.
 After hitting an all-time high of $490.76 in July 2021, Roku shares, which have lost 77.1% so far this year, fell rapidly to hit a low of $47.27 on Oct. 24.  Since then, Roku shares have staged a modest rally, closing Thursday at $52.27, although they remain about 90% below their all-time highs.
 At current levels, the San Jose, California-based streaming device maker's market capitalization stands at $7.2 billion, up from $60 billion when it peaked.
 Roku's stock has become very attractive after falling this year, given its impressive growth in active accounts and improved monetization from existing and new users.
 The next major catalyst is expected to come when Roku releases its third-quarter results after the US market closes on Wednesday, November 2."	0.53	1	0	1	question	2022-10-28T15:41:03Z	yfn4l8	t3

# Why is this gobbledygook relevant?

The Federal Reserve creates money and uses it to buy bonds. They do this to push interest rates down and to put more money into the economy. Low rates mean people can borrow more, spend more, and afford higher prices. More spending and higher prices mean people feel rich, and businesses hire new employees.

But, if prices rise too quickly or people borrow too much, the Fed does the opposite. It sells the bonds it has and then destroys the money it receives. These sales push interest rates up and take money out of the economy. Higher rates mean people can't borrow or spend as much and must pay lower prices. It makes people feel poorer than before, stops them from being able to spend as much, and makes businesses trim employment.

In addition to this, the Fed borrows and lends to banks. If a bank doesn't have enough money for a day or two, it can borrow from the Fed. If it has too much, it can lend to the Fed. A group of people who work for the Fed, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), decide the interest rate that the Fed will pay for, or demand of, these short-term loans.

The Fed does these because they believe in two objectives: first, a low and stable inflation rate is good for the economy, and second, that minimising unemployment is desirable.

# FAQs

**Why do you look at weekly average balance sheet data instead of the Wednesday level?**

It takes time for asset settlement to occur. The holdings on any given day will fluctuate wildly—especially given that the Fed owns almost $9trn of assets. The weekly average is smoother and more indicative of the monetary policy trend.

Both these companies are heavily specialized in the automotive industry for EVs and have enjoyed high demand. But now it seems the industry is starting to show cracks after Wolf Speed's cut. The most interesting phenomenon about On Semi is the OTM puts for January 20, 2023, which show over 17,000 bought for the strike of 30$ and 15,000 bought for the strike of $50. 

No one knows for certain about the future of these 2 companies but there is a serious risk of ON Semi-being butchered for cutting guidance."	0.5	0	0	0	question	2022-10-28T14:29:37Z	yfln6q	t3

wallstreetbets	napoleon10_1	self.wallstreetbets	8	I want to learn this stuff	"Hi, crazy awesome people here on WSB reddit. I've been looking into investing into stocks, commodities and indexes for quite some time now. I've even tried some demo accounts of a few brokers (now I'm at XTB's demo, where I'm currently at a 125% the starting capital). But I still don't quite orient myself in this world. I'm trying to look at economy news, and learn about things that affect prices of things. 
However I still don't have the knowledge to even be able to have a proper talk about this with somebody or, more importantly, to base an actual financial decision on it.


I'm aware of the rather chaotic YOLO nature of this place (and I love it, though I feel a bit more responsible myself), but I still believe you guys have learned about this somehow, and I'd like to ask for any of your personal suggestions on how to approach investing so that I will at least have a chance to properly navigate it, and potentially make my way up. 

PS: I'm in Czechia, so central Europe (but still if you have some US only things, I'm here to hear it anyway)

***it gets removed***

This is the worst. Why bother putting in the effort if no one is going to see it?

Our data shows that post and comment removals for new users are a huge deterrent and the reason why many people stop contributing. 

Over the years we've really tried to make it easier to post (some might say it's too easy...) but when things do get caught, the options are few and terrible. 

You can:

1. Complain about mods, say fuck Reddit, and never come back

2. Send a modmail in and at best get a reply 30 minutes later (by which time your submission is dead)

...and that's it.

#Introducing a third option:

3. Hop into a voice channel and immediately speak with a moderator who can reinstate your post

This is one of many new moderation features we're excited to ship that will make submitting posts easier than ever. 

This is just one step towards encouraging more high quality, high effort, posts back into the sub.

Really looking forward to sharing what comes next. A lot of this has been in the works for months if not over a year."	0.59	4	0	4		2022-11-05T08:57:53Z	ymmoxo	t3

wallstreetbets	tiswuttis	self.wallstreetbets	5	TGIF: TSLA gain (not the minimum required for me to tag gain, but here are some of my thoughts).	"I hope you all are well! I’m only a year old member of the page, but thought i’d share my thoughts because while this page is fun, it can also be toxic at times and not overly helpful or insightful. That being said, there are plenty of times I have seen positivity and  insight. I’m not a professional at this at all, but thought i’d share my thoughts after my first year of trading options…. But first here was my trade today:

I took a short position (bought puts) on TSLA towards the top of its 207-226 channel this morning. Took 2 contacts at 220ish. 1 additional contract at 223ish. I had my stop loss set, and then went to my actual job. The thesis was that it would get back to 207 support in short to mid term.


 I obviously got very lucky that TSLA severely underperformed today and happened to hit my target. I’ve always hung on to losers too long and winners too short, so i was sure to move my stop to break even when it moved my way, and then continually moved my stop up as the trade worked in my favor. Eventually got stopped out around 206 for $1,710. Felt nice because the risk reward was there, and everything made sense, obviously lucky that TSLA was weak with twitter debacle, but nice to have one go my way.


I’m now long two contracts as you can see above. Thesis is TSLA will return to 220s and stay within this channel in short to mid term. If i get stopped out monday, so be it, but the risk reward for me makes sense.


Things i’ve learned the last year: 


1. I can’t trade 0dte contracts. It’s straight gambling for me and i suck at that. I’m also too busy with my actual job to monitor trades like these which i assume require a high level of attention to detail. 3-4 Weeks minimum preferred for me.


2. The trade has to have a clear out front thesis that doesn’t evolve to fit your bias as the trade plays out.

3. Position sizing is so important for my financial and mental well being. I have to be sure to never risk more than a certain percentage of my portfolio. “Preserve precious capital” as a famous trader says makes sense to me


4. The better my mental and physical health the clearer my mind is with trading.


5. Mistakes happen. Basically blew up my account last fall when beginning options and while i hated myself, it taught me a lot about myself, and my tendencies.

6. I prefer to stick with one stock and listen to a few youtubers i like that analyze it. Simple things like supply and demand level, rsi and macd, and paying attention to fed news and the indices.

I’m not an OG here, but thought i’d share my thoughts and a positive trade i made as i continue to grow and improve. Maybe the mods will remove, idk. TGIF


TLDR: i have learned the hard way about risk management, having a real thesis before trades, and avoiding theta decay/ giving myself time on trades by picking better (in my opinion) expiration dates. Also, if i can’t sleep or feel anxious after the closing bell, i know i am not sizing properly and over risking …

Be safe, enjoy your weekend, momentum is real and let it start rolling in the right direction 😀"	0.63	5	0	5	question	2022-11-05T05:13:39Z	ymimwr	t3

It is me again here doing more shenanigans with equity and numbers! As for request by many users, after the AMC stock evaluation that i did, here i will illustrate if the company is ok in terms of fundamental analysis! I still have lots to learn and many experience more to gain, so please be understandable if something that i write here looks like a smelly turn :(

Enjoy the Reading!

**TL:DR**

* Company in dire situation
* Fair Value of $15
* High Speculative Play
* Long Term ---&gt; Bankruptcy if situation doesn't change
* Not Recommended for Long term Investment due to high risk
* Good for speculative plays, 90% chance to have price movement between -5% and 5% with 10% chance to get outliers

# Risk Analysis - Statistical Analysis

Taking in count the stock's price movement from 2002 to 2022, we have the following data:

|Expected Minimum Return|0.16%|
|:-|:-|
|Variance|0.26%|
|Standard Deviation|5.07%|

Taking in count the stock's price movement from 1st December 2021 to Today, 5th November 2022, we have the following data: 4739

|Expected Minimum Return|1.09%|
|:-|:-|
|Variance|1.72%|
|Standard Deviation|13.11%|

[Distribution of returns](https://preview.redd.it/dfxkwsgyh1y91.png?width=875&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f17061e5cf664cb8f1581cb8875364253f3ae991)

Statistically Speaking, investing in GME has a high probability to give you a return around -5 and 5%, with 43.46% of the data population between -5% and 0 and 45.94% between 0 and 5%.

This gives us a 10.60% chance to get an outlier return from the historical data.

Standard Deviation suggests a 13.11% to ride on a price movement higher than 5% or lower than -5%. In the long run the chance of getting outlier is reduced to 5%.

# Risk Analysis - Market Risk

The FED has raised rates to 4%, we will factor in a 4.50% rate instead.

Risk Free Rate is 4.15%

Market Expected Return of 9.40%

Risk Premium of 5.25%

With its current amount of Cash &amp; Cash Equivalents and without any drastic changes in the company structure and business model, GME is expected to burn is cash within 35 Months. Taking in mind receivables and other liquidity, it still have 39 months remaining in operation.

The company can avoid this by taking more loans or selling parts of the company and other assets.

Company doesn't pass Acid Test, and it is in a dire financial struggle to survive.

Still expecting negative income and cash flow from operations for 2023.

Debt is not critical, this shall allows some room for a possible long term loan.

Current Cash can cover only 94% of current liabilities. The company should be able to cover it with receivables.

ROE, ROA, ROIC and ROC terrible.

ROE is in recover, so GG

ROIC worsen and ROA is stable

This suggest that, yes the management is trying to fix the company, with some positive outcome, but they are struggling a lot right now.

Income quality getting away from danger zone, but still in bad situations.

Gross profit margin worsened. Company cannot manage well costs, this is probably due to inflation and macro.

There are ""***Strategic and Operational Risks Related to Digital Asset Initiatives""*** *that can have huge positive impact as well as dire outcome if it fails. This is a huge risk factor.*

In the mid term, 1-2 years, the company shall gradually trade down from current price to $15 with possible spikes due to external factors. Expect (90% chance) movements between -5% and 5% cause historical price action with a 10% chance to cash in or go tits up.

Fundamentals point toward bankruptcy, but as for now, if the management play their card well there is a possibility to recover.

With current balance sheet, market  health and macro, the company is fucked up.

consider a stock that has experienced several highs and lows over the last year through both bullish and bearish trending patterns. A technical analyst using a Bollinger  channel may see that the price is approaching its support trendline. If the stock has a positive weighted alpha it can be an affirmation that the stock’s price has largely been gaining over the last year, **supporting another bulish push higher.**


**why is a European Germany company rising its revenue guidance when apparently Europe is gone to sh**t ? You will find out why it is my honest opinion that Warren buffets reasoning to buy when everyone fears is can be applied for Bayer**

The 2022, full year growth outlook raise  is significant, particularly in its crop science division;:

1. Now expecting a 10% previously 5% in the seed and crop protection market for 2022, driven high quality prices for seeds and crop commodities and inflation.

2. Pharmaceutical division to expand by 6% previously 5%

3.conhmsr health 5% from 4% 

**remember this is just by the end of 2022, if the conditions persist the growth outlook widens, it seems like  the basic needs or medication and crops are recession proof when picking the correct company**

If you keep  reading bellow  later,  you ill find out of crop production ever decreased in history.

**The top 2 challenges  and why they are going in favour of Bayer** 

**1) litgations 2) europe economy**

**European economy and the rise of the germans** 

**The dark winter**
- we all know European is heading into a difficult winter, although energy prices have gone down since i write this, it is no guarantee they will remain so. However, the germans are going to spend there way out of this winter and are poised to avoid a recession in 2023.

*it has already begun*

Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase. 



1) winter recession avoided 

https://m.ca.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/germany-dodges-recession-but-inflation-climbs-to-116-2811016

Why will it benefit the underlying stock? 

Spending - stocks go up in spending times bud. 

2) surprising growth,  will it be enough to outpace inflation ?  For 2023  Germany is likely to be okay, and Bayers product are essentials, during hard times Bayer makes money as well.

https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/short_news/germany-under-fire-for-canibalistic-e200-billion-investment/

3) relief plan makes  the EU  worried, if Germany avoid recession by spending, other European nations will want to follow the idea,  inflation cannot be controlled like this. EU therefore sounds the alarm and potential consequences, it is likely that not too many nations will follow suit in my opinion , Germany can afford to be spending, not many  European nations can, making Germany the exception, in fact if Germany being the biggest economy in Europe  makes it through, much of Europe will also make I through. 

The worried citi suggest the following 

*The proposals could cut 2 percentage points off inflation in the next year, according to Citi, but they are unlikely to prevent an economic contraction. The package “may soften the coming recession but also poses risks, in our view,” Citi analysts said in a note released last Friday.*

Why are we using words like economic contraction  all of a sudden instead of recession?

- **The litigations over roundup** and *glysophate*


 Bayer is still facing litigations due to the acquisition of Monsanto and RoundUp and during the last earnings call, Werner Baumann gave updated numbers. There are about 141,000 claims in total and about 108,000 have been settled.

Remember they have already set the cash aside, have won or litigated the majority of all cases. The rest are likely to head the same path.

Here is glysophate  surging 300% in 2021 https://www.agweb.com/news/crops/crop-production/glyphosate-prices-soar-much-300-and-thats-if-you-can-even-get-it

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king: 

Take a look at some of these charts in the past 59 years  have crop production globally  ever decreased over time ? Never, ever.

With crop production increasing, it drags along with it:  Crop Science

lawsuit:
Counter point and what investors should know :


For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic. This includes recent conclusions by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the EU’s Assessment Group on Glyphosate (AGG), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), and the leading health authorities in Germany, Australia, Korea, Canada, New Zealand, and Japan.

https://www.bayer.com/en/roundup-litigation-five-point-plan

One of Bayer's core defenses in the litigation is that the EPA has decided glyphosate is not carcinogenic and not a risk to public health."	0.9	8	0	8	question	2022-11-05T02:48:48Z	ymfmmn	t3

wallstreetbets	Optimal_Land7816	self.wallstreetbets	9	Anybody buying the Zendesk 77 dollar call options?	"Yoooo, Zendesk is apparently being taken private at 77.5 per share by Hellman and Friedman before 12/31/2022.

I read online that a Form 25 has to be filed with US securities regulator SEC within 60 days of the first issue of proxy soliciting materials for voting on matters related to the buyout. This form certifies that the stock will be delisted by the exchange upon completion of the merger.

On September 02, Zendesk published the first round of proxy soliciting materials. The deal was then approved by Zendesk shareholders during a meeting on September 19. The Form 25 was now most likely has already been filed around November 02.

The Form 25 won't be made available to the public or be ""considered valid"" unless Zendesk issues a press release indicating completion of the deal, and that the exchange has received evidence of a certificate of merger from Zendesk. Upon all conditions being satisfied, the exchange removes the listing 10 days after the Form 25 becomes public. In 90 days, the SEC nullifies the registration of the securities. If Zendesk were to go public in the future, it would be assigned a new CUSP ID.

When a stock gets delisted as a result of a company going private, options are cash settled for the difference between the buyout price and the strike price.

Given that deals tend to be completed within a week of the Form 25 being drafted and confidentially submitted to the SEC, are you guys willing to risk $5 to buy 77 dollar call options expiring 11/11/2022 in anticipation of the deal closing next week?

&amp;#x200B;

# TLDR

Zendesk is incorporated in Delaware according to SEC filings.

If the status changes to an L (consolidated), the transaction has went through.

[https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/Ecorp/EntitySearch/NameSearch.aspx](https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/Ecorp/EntitySearch/NameSearch.aspx)

Zendesk apparently has a charitable foundation, and  the status for their charitable organization will likely change from Exempt to M (Merged) one day early before Zendesk Inc changes their status from General to L (Consolidated) .

**FILE         NUMBER ENTITY NAME**

5606971  ZENDESK CHARITABLE FOUNDATION

4661237   ZENDESK, INC.

[https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/Ecorp/FieldDesc.aspx#ENTITY%20TYPE](https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/Ecorp/FieldDesc.aspx#ENTITY%20TYPE)

It apparently costs 20 dollars each time I want to refresh the status of the entity or to check their filing history :(

Changing the status of a company from General to Merged takes about 2-3 weeks apparently, or 24 hours if expedited services are requested.

After getting the certificate of merger between Zendesk Charitable and Zendesk Inc, the company needs to pursue a certificate of consolidation to create a new holding company. When all the documents are prepared, they are sent to the company through snail mail.

If you are checking the site for real time updates, clicking on the link of a consolidated company will likely cause you to be redirected to the original search page.

If you click on any one of the corporations and the unofficial certificate of good standing fails to load, the company's status has also been changed to consolidation. A potential merger arbitrage will be available since return mail does take at least 1 day."	0.78	5	0	5	question	2022-11-04T23:55:35Z	ymbn97	t3

One of the biggest intraday dumps and recoveries I have seen in a long time and also one of the first times ive seen it with the VIX at such a low level. 

Next week we have election midterms and we have CPI. I will this weekend or next week sometimes post my CPI trade plan to the server but for now here is my expectations for CPI next week after running the numbers.

https://preview.redd.it/elizrxa930y91.png?width=484&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=523d615fe4c4afde022a1f70471e1cc3a5b4bae9

https://preview.redd.it/z3snoeo930y91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9017c5f75bba431e2e87901486bfadaa448c65b

Lets take a little more of a zoomed out look on the daily this time. What do we see? We see that we are still well within that green bear channel of 2022 and are holding right around that red dotted 50% retracement line. We have also formed over the last 2 months now a very sizeable black rising wedge that support was actually reconfirmed on today. We also held the red channel support of 370.6 extremely well today and rejected the 378 channel resistance all in one single day (which is impressive). Effectively we are stuck in this train and rising wedge until otherwise proven. 

Bull case for next week- bulls want to see a midterm election week rally and see a rally into CPI. First step is taking out that 378 resistance and establishing that as support. From there its time to take the red resistance line out from FOMC and look to retest the daily 100ema resistance around 388-390. 

Bear case for next week- with a looming CPI ahead and the FOMC pivot on the pivot this week bears will look to continue to reject 378 channel resistance and eventually break through and close under the 370.5 support and break the support of the black rising wedge. Once that is broken bears have opened the downside to re-test the 350 to 360 support area. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2bfkkd5a30y91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e512c7c006be622548dd43c6fd3a4df6d5346c99

On the weekly timeframe you can see we actually did break the rising wedge that is present from last week. However, we did come down and retest the weekly 200ema and confirmed that as support this week. With this candle body closing inside of last weeks bears and bulls both have an opportunity to break out next week and this could be the start of a bull flag if the bulls can defend 375.9 next week. 

Key support- 375.9 -&gt; 363.6 -&gt; 357

Key resistance- 390.2 -&gt; 408.6

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2jv8guqa30y91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b0221f5520ba291ee83d3caff612c9865da3810

Futures has a similar rising wedge formed with the downside resistance from FOMC. Overall a really nice double bottom and bullishly engulfing candle on futes daily that should provide some upside for Monday next week. Bulls need to retake that 3805 resistance next week early and bears will look to take out 3710 support early next week. Both of these remain key pivot points for futures. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/eufo1b8b30y91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5a7796d72bee08c5cf9213acc44204d9a54b92e

Futures (SPY too really) has a overall macro falling wedge with a blue bull channel that has a blue/ red rising wedge inside of it… yay TA! Overall this was a double top on the weekly at 3910, however, this could easily form into a 3775 double bottom come Sunday night at open and easily lead to an upside push next week. With the weekly 200ema being held once again we should look at upside not downside. 

Key support- 3775 -&gt; 3705 -&gt; 3590

Key resistance- 3910 -&gt; 4085

Apple had one of the most interesting intradays I have seen on a non major catalysts day in a long time. Apple went all the day down to the October CPI LOD within one penny and someone still managed to rally back and close over 138.2. I actually REALLY would have liked to take apple calls with this closure back over key 138.2 support but it was EOD and too late plus I already had TESLA calls im swinging and SPY I opened instead. 

Apple will look to attempt to gap fill that 145 gap for the bulls and bears are going to attempt to close under 138.2 and put in a new 52 week low. 

&amp;#x200B;

The weekly show just how strong this 138.2 support is for Apple and why I was so ready to pull the trigger on calls but was too slow. You can also see that Apple did close back under its weekly 100ema and put In its biggest red week since March 2020 during the COVID crash. 

Key support – 138.2 -&gt; 133.3 -&gt; 129.1

Key resistance- 141.2 -&gt; 147.1 -&gt; 150.8

Tesla as I had mentioned continues to range in that 205.6 to 234 red channel. I had played some overnight calls on tesla for a huge 47.8% win at open on a 7dte and thankfully closed at open because wow did it get absolutely smacked down. Tesla put in a $20.72 drop from HOD to LOD which was 156% of its average 10day range. A pretty impressive range for Tesla that’s for sure. The biggest thing we have forming here on Tesla is that huge blue/ black diamond and we bounced hard one again off the 205.6 support range. I will be looking for an upside move next week on Tesla and remain bullish especially as long as we continue to hold 205.6 support. 

&amp;#x200B;

AS you can see on Tesla weekly chart we are still within that downward bear channel and did reject an attempt to breakout over the weekly 8ema. There is also a breakout triangle forming with key level of 224.2 and 207.8 for next week. 

Key supports- 204.4 -&gt; 192.1

Key resistance- 228.3 -&gt; 245

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/157xkwhe30y91.png?width=610&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad41f6767f0490a95c28e16704e60fc6bbd4cee0

We finally saw some volatility with the VIX today with a pretty large rebound spike when we had that huge 1115am dump. However, the vix remains in the downward channel and realistically until we see that resistance broken and see a major major bearish catalyst (cough CPI cough) I wouldn’t be shorting just yet. You COULD start adding slow longer DTE puts like 30-60 dte but I feel you are still early and are just wasting money. WE are also approaching that key 23.6 VIX support area and funny enough before the September CPI we actually were right at the 23.6 support area too. Perhaps we see a pretty bullish three days next week on the markets much like September leading into CPI and then CPI starts the next leg down headed into December. 

Overall I lean for a bullish Monday at least with a possible choppy Tuesday/ Wednesday as markets prepare for CPI but there is a very good chance we could see a pretty impressive green week next week and end up all the back up near 390 before CPI hits. The higher we are the bigger drop I believe CPI could potentially bring for us. 

Daily log- 

This was another amazing week for me. The week really did suck Monday and Tuesday and then after taking that bigger L on Wednesday I was able to recover today and end up finishing the week off going 11 for 11 today with 4 for 4 on scalps and 7 for 7 on level to level plays. Note- a lot of people are inquiring more about my level to level plays so this is something I will once again try to cover and I will make a post this weekend about it I hope. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jshjt4ze30y91.png?width=888&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fccc1c3e198a4ab59265a8fb834330bfc48e8ecd

Interestingly enough… this is now the 2nd week in a row where my level to level plays have netted a greater profit then my actual scalps. This is something I will continue to monitor as time goes forward and I will continue to adjust as time goes on. This week was also extremely tough to scalp as Monday and Tuesday were very untradeable and then Wednesday with the IV spiking was tougher to trade too for big gains. However, with this being the 2nd week in a row with these results I will continue to monitor and see going forward if this trend holds. But for anyone following me who struggles to get in on the scalps while obviously the win rate is no perfect on the L2L plays and never will be with the built in price target stop loss and take profit target (tho I regrettably always take profits early) the profits should greatly outweigh the losses. Definitely something to keep in mind going forward for me. 

Youtube will be up later!  
 

Hope you guys had a great week. See you next week!"	0.85	14	0	14	dd	2022-11-04T23:17:31Z	ymaqa7	t3

I’m new to wsb, I discussed my stocks more with friends but they all gave up on trading lol. I made big profits in the last years with Tesla and other tech stuff (about 500%). I was basically a buy and hold investor but started with options some months ago to leverage my portfolio. It did well but I’m less optimistic now. I think the next years will be though and shorting the Nasdaq 100 is still a good move now. But I’ll still hold Tesla and Apple. Maybe some other large caps too - It’s hard to let them go after all those years of profits.

The only thing I’m really optimistic right now is Porsche. It startet only about one month ago and the Porsche family is happily buying back as much stocks as possible. They set a very low price on the stock to buy it back very cheap. I think they secretly want to buy back everything to own it again like in the early 2000s. I’m not sure if they are genius or crazy… Anyway I also calculated a target price of 154€ per share in the short term and expect it much higher if they really want to buy it back. The fundamentals and future are amazing and I bought lots of lots of calls. Maybe some of you have also looked at P911 and wants to discuss it.

I’m happy to hear about your opinions :)"	0.66	2	0	2	dd	2022-11-04T21:17:47Z	ym7pet	t3

wallstreetbets	caprazzi	self.wallstreetbets	6	Paramount (PARA) - The Cheapest Stock in the Market	"Just coming on to share the mind-bogglingly low valuation of Paramount (PARA). Consider the following:

1.) Paramount possesses the fastest growing streaming offering in the market, Paramount+.

2.) Paramount owns CBS and has the rights to broadcast most NFL games as well as Premier League Soccer.

3.) Paramount Pictures has had a wildly successful year, including the release of Top Gun Maverick, the 5th highest grossing film of all time. 

Despite this, PARA shares are trading at an embarrassingly low valuation:

1.) Price/earnings multiple of less than 8.

2.) Approximately one third price/sales.

3.) Less than half of book value.

Paramount is definitely a company in transition, but this valuation dislocation is borderline criminal. On top of this beautiful stock sundae, you get more than 6% in dividend yield just to hold the shares while you wait for the price to normalize, and the short interest is just under 15%.

wallstreetbets	ThreeD710	self.wallstreetbets	2	Effects of Inflationary Boom/Bust or Deflationary Boom/Bust on the businesses involved in Energy	"This is a abridged post and is a summary of the following four scenarios –

1. **Inflationary Boom** – increase in prices along with an increase in economic growth
2. **Inflationary Bust or Stagflation** – increase in prices along with a decrease in economic growth
3. **Deflationary Boom** – decrease in prices along with an increase in economic growth
4. **Deflationary Bust** – decrease in prices along with a decrease in economic growth

And how they affect –

1. **Demand for energy**
2. **Investments in energy**

These scenarios occur in varying frequency and sequence over short periods (about 5 years) of time, which combine to form a regime. A regime can either be inflationary (increasing prices) or deflationary (decreasing prices) and can last several decades. The last four decades have been deflationary, and the next four, **appear inflationary**.

**Why do the four scenarios matter**\*\*?\*\*

Because the change in prices and economic growth affect the rate of inflation, which in turn affects the interest rate, which affects how much money is in the economy. The amount of money in the economy affects commercial and retail borrowing and spending, leading to an increase/decrease in demand for goods and services. **An increase/decrease in the demand for goods and services leads to an increase/decrease in the demand for energy**.

&amp;#x200B;

**How can inflation and economic growth be tracked**\*\*?\*\* (A few examples)

1. **Headline CPI** – measures the rate of change of inflation on a monthly, quarterly, and annual basis
2. **Rent Inflation** – comprises 32% of the headline CPI
3. **Services Inflation** – comprises 57% of the headline CPI
4. **Import Prices** – rate of change in the prices of goods and services purchased from foreign sellers
5. **Producer Price Index** \- measures price change for commodities sold for personal consumption, capital investment, government, and export
6. **Chicago Fed National Activity Index** \- is designed to gauge overall economic activity and related inflationary pressure
7. **Capacity Utilization** \- used to measure the rate at which potential output levels are being met or used

**Why are we heading to a regime change which will be inflationary**\*\*?\*\*

**Let us begin by quickly summarizing the disinflationary drivers of the last 40 years** –

1. **China** – the country managed to bring over 600 million people into the workforce and out of poverty. This helped improve their lives but also provided cheap labor to the global economy. At the same time, China laid the massive manufacturing and logistics infrastructure which has made it the manufacturing powerhouse that it is today
2. **Collapse of USSR** – led to the migration of cheap labor from Eastern Europe to Mainland Europe
3. **Outsourcing** – exasperated with high inflation from the mid 1960’s to the mid 1980’s, developed economies willingly accepted the idea to outsource or offshore their manufacturing to China
4. **Immigration** – the same reason stated in point 3 led to developed economies opening up to immigration from developing economies which led to wages being driven down
5. **Debt** – Increase in debt (through monetary policy) led to businesses running on the loss-making model as well as increased competition
6. **Technology** – the ultimate disinflationary driver which made the World smaller, expedited exchange and execution of ideas, gaslighted innovation, and increased efficiency exponentially

**Now let us understand which of the above disinflationary drivers can slow down or turn inflationary** –

1. **China** – demography is getting older and wealthier and labor-intensive industries such as apparel and footwear are moving to Vietnam and Bangladesh. Also, it could be possible that new disinflationary drivers such as Vietnam, Bangladesh, and India can fill in the capacity of China.
2. **Outsourcing** – many developed countries have elected or are electing populist governments that promise to bring back the jobs by reshoring their industries. Also, Covid lockdowns and the Russian – Ukraine conflict has shown governments how globalized supply chains are vulnerable and de-risking supply chains to some extent by localizing them would be a strategic necessity.
3. **Immigration** – again, many developed countries have elected or are electing governments that promise or have a mandate in place that caps immigration which would cut off access to foreign cheap labor and talent.
4. **Debt** – many developed countries are running debt to GDP ratios in excess of 100% and any increase in debt through monetary policy would be a very unpopular opinion among the population

**And the new drivers of the Inflationary Regime?**

1. **ESG** – The transition to Net Zero involves a large negative supply shock and mega capex
2. **Inequality** – the disinflationary regime of the last 40 years worked in favor of the capitalists against the labor, and the monetary policies in place since 2008 exacerbated this inequality. The current inflationary period will put pressure on governments to work on closing the gap in inequality, which will further increase pressures on inflation
3. **Fiscal Policy** – governments are already putting money in the hands of the people so that they can weather the inflation or are providing subsidies. Fiscal policy is proven to be inflationary.

&amp;#x200B;

**As this is an abridged version, I have briefly listed the reasons for my base case of an inflationary regime. I believe that we are currently in a stagflation environment and may either remain in a stagflation environment for a while or alternate between an inflationary boom and stagflation.**

**Having said that, I would like to briefly mention a few of my thoughts or rather, my musings. Will post these musings in a Part 2 Post as this post is already long.**

**Will update this post with the link to Part 2 when I post it.**"	0.56	1	0	1	dd	2022-11-04T19:58:07Z	ym5osp	t3

This post may seem like a joke, but it's not.

I earn approximately $3500 per year, that's right, not per month but per year lol.

That's why I always wanted to have a lot of money, not to spend on myself, but to give dignity and meet basic needs to my family.

That's when I realized that I should know the rules of the financial market, to play the money game.

I realized that there are a lot of unfair things, such as: The bank would lend me 125x an amount to invest in a stock, but they wouldn't lend me the same amount to finance a house.

So I decided to stop being sad about it, I accepted reality.

wallstreetbets	predictany007	self.wallstreetbets	8	Apple is now valued more than Alphabet, Amazon and Meta combined	" 

* Apple's market value is now higher than that of Alphabet, Amazon and Meta combined.
* The iPhone maker's worth stands at $2.307 trillion, while its tech peers add up to $2.306 trillion.
* Tech stocks have suffered after posting poor quarterly earnings, but Apple dodged a wipeout.

Apple is now worth more than fellow tech giants Alphabet, Amazon and Meta combined, after it ended trading Wednesday with a market value of $2.307 trillion.

At the same time, the market caps of its three tech giant peers added up to $2.306 trillion at the close of trading Wednesday. Google parent Alphabet's market cap stood at $1.126 trillion, Amazon's at $939.78 billion and Facebook parent Meta's at $240.07 billion, Yahoo Finance data showed.

Overall, Big Tech stocks suffered a brutal selloff last week on the back of disappointing quarterly earnings. But Apple's stock has outperformed its peers after it beat Wall Street's revenue and profit forecasts for its fourth quarter.

The iPhone maker's shares soared 8% in the wake of its results. After their earnings reports, Meta plunged more than 20%, Amazon fell about 10%, while Alphabet saw a single-digit decline.

Alphabet, Amazon and Meta's lackluster earnings signaled that demand for digital advertising is flagging. The poorly-received results have helped wipe billions off their market values as their shares fell, and pushed Amazon out of the trillion-dollar market cap club.

Over the past five sessions, Apple's stock has risen 0.16%, while Alphabet has fallen 5.7%, Amazon is down 17.0% and Meta has lost 7.6% over that period.

Despite Apple's achievement, its market cap has fallen back from its $2.193 trillion value at the end of 2021. A series of headwinds — high inflation, rising interest rates, fears of recession and the Ukraine war among them — have meant tech stocks have struggled in 2022 as investors lost appetite for higher risk assets.

wallstreetbets	predictany007	self.wallstreetbets	7	Hedge fund Elliott warns of more pain to come after 2022 market rout	" 

Florida-headquartered hedge fund Elliott Management believes the global economy is in an “extremely challenging” situation which could lead to hyperinflation.

In a report on Thursday (Nov 3), the Financial Times (FT) cited a letter sent to investors (and seen by the newspaper) that “investors should not assume they have ‘seen everything’” because they have been through the peaks and troughs of the 1987 crash, the dot-com boom and the 2008 global financial crisis and previous bear and bull markets.

The British daily newspaper said the firm, led by billionaire Paul Singer and Jonathan Pollock, added that the “extraordinary” period of cheap money is coming to an end and has “made possible a set of outcomes that would be at or beyond the boundaries of the entire post-WWII period”.

The letter said the world is “on the path to hyperinflation”, which could lead to “global societal collapse and civil or international strife”.

Elliott executives estimated that markets have not fallen enough yet and equity markets could drop more than 50% would be “normal”, adding that they couldn’t predict when that would happen.

They warned clients that the idea that “‘we will not panic because we have seen this before’ does not comport with the current facts”.

They blamed central bank policymakers for the current global economic situation, saying they had been “dishonest” about the reason for high inflation.

They said lawmakers had shirked responsibility by blaming it on supply chain disruption caused by the pandemic instead of loose monetary policy imposed two years ago during the Covid-19 peak.

&gt;The FOMC’s goal is to bring inflation back down to the Committee’s 2 percent target over time, and as Wednesday’s FOMC statement and communications stressed, this will likely entail raising rates to a sufficiently restrictive level and then holding there for some time. 

&gt; A focus on the level (not the pace) is what “resolve” looks like in this second policy phase.

The pain is nowhere near done gentlemen.

We continue to articulate a different and more stringent test for the economic conditions that would need to be met before raising the federal funds rate.”

In this regard, Powell only slightly adjusted the Fed’s view on inflation from “transitory” to “expected to be transitory.”

He could have just held the shares for the dividend payout hold investment strategy. But he sells his Apple stock shares every single time."	0.69	48	0	48	question	2022-11-04T17:18:12Z	ym1prs	t3

wallstreetbets	NASDQplayer97	self.wallstreetbets	2	IGPK - Integrated Cannabis Solutions Issues Corporate Update	"Integrated Cannabis will encompass 3 operating divisions all held under its wholly owned holding company. These divisions will be: Cannabis, Branding and a 3rd to be named later (this division is being created from within). Our plan provides for each of these divisions to be generating revenue by the end of December 2023.

We estimate that we will file the Super 8-K and financial statements within days after receiving the audit for Consolidated Apparel, Inc (""Consolidated""), which is currently producing about $1.2 million in annual revenues and will remove the Company's Shell designation and add revenue to our books. Consolidated has identified several acquisition targets that complement the Consolidated operations, which if assimilated will potentially increase annual revenues. These transactions, if completed will be structured as Asset Purchases to expedite closings.

In July of 2022, the Company issued 598,800 shares of Series B Preferred for 49.9% of GCTR Management, LLC (""GCTR""), a management company in the cannabis sector in California with two clients. GCTR currently grosses revenues of approximately $300,000 per month. We have an option to purchase the remaining 50.1% percent but will look to extend that date until the end of 2023, so we can pursue other opportunities to increase our presence in the cannabis sector in California. We will continually seek new acquisitions to potentially increase our revenues and will look to lock down 49.9% of two other entities with options to acquire the remaining portion by the end of 2023.

We have agreed to work on new projects with our partners in California with each side owning 50%.

Our new division is being set up from within services of a sector our management has decades of experience in, which we are planning to roll out during the 4th quarter of 2022.

Additionally, in the 4th quarter, we plan to begin setting up operations in the Caribbean to expand both our Branding and Cannabis divisions. For our Branding division, we plan to manufacture products on the island to be sold on the island and export products back to the United States. For Cannabis, we plan to acquire the real estate and equipment needed to operate a manufacturing operation. We will not be involved in the day-to-day operations, but plan to receive a monthly fee for the building and use of the equipment equal to 25% of the monthly revenue.

The Company, in compliance with SEC regulations, will use social media outlets like Facebook or Twitter and its own website at [www.igpk.org](http://www.igpk.org/) to announce key information in compliance with Regulation FD.

A new report delivered to Maryland lawmakers this week shows the national market for legal cannabis growing to $72 billion per year by 2030.

A $75 Billion Industry

The report, which was prepared and presented to the work group by Mathew Swinburne, associate director of Network for Public Health Law-Eastern Region of Baltimore, includes information from New Frontier Data that projects steady growth of the nationwide market as current markets mature and new states are added to the roster of legal cannabis states. Growing from $32 billion in 2022, the projection estimates a total market nationwide of $72 billion by 2030. 

“We know that the cannabis industry is a profitable industry,” said Swinburne. “This is a new industry that is filled with economic opportunity and that opportunity is only growing,” he added. “Although this industry presents some significant economic opportunities, communities of color are missing out on this cannabis boom.”

Swinburne told the work group that jobs in the cannabis industry rose from about 321,000 in 2020 to approximately 428,000 a year later. However, the report also notes that 81% of cannabis businesses are owned by white people and 58% of businesses have no employees who are members of minority groups. 

Main benefactors of this growth remain TRULIEVE, VERANO, GREENTHUMB, CURALEAF, CRESCO Labs 

The five largest MSOS - and most profitable - currently operating in USA.

Hip-hop mogul and entrepreneur is acquiring marijuana assets to be divested in merger of Cresco Labs and Columbia Care

Sean “Diddy” Combs has agreed to purchase licensed marijuana operations in three states for up to $185 million, adding a new business to a portfolio that includes fashion, media and spirits.

If approved by U.S. and state regulators, the deal could create the nation’s largest Black-owned and licensed cannabis company. Mr. Combs said he wants to use the business as a platform to increase Black participation in the cannabis industry.

He said he decided to enter the market to help address long-running inequities. Black people have been disproportionately arrested for marijuana crimes, research has shown. They also comprise a tiny percentage of those making money from the legal cannabis market. In the 26 years since California first legalized medical marijuana, cannabis has grown into a $27 billion legal business in the U.S. and is projected to reach $42 billion in annual U.S. sales by 2026, according to data service BDSA.

The recipients of the proceeds - cresco labs and columbia care who are merging - are one of the top five components of MSOS ETF - which includes TRULIEVE, VERANO, CURALEAF, and GREENTHUMB

There's no especially bad news that might come up for the company right now. Any next update to Cyberpunk will be welcome, there is Q3 around the corner with big earnings caused by Edgerunners. Then we have Phantom Liberty. I also think they hold some surprise for Christmas. My only fear is that W3 update will be below expectations since delays when it comes to it is a bad sign.

The stock is also shorted to hell currently as well.

Do your DD. I'm in for long, average 147PLN (I bought some for 155PLN at the start of the big fall and held through all of that)."	0.9	9	0	9	dd	2022-11-04T10:19:05Z	ylsktb	t3

CEO Harry Vafias Commented

This quarter’s unprecedented profitability growth is solid proof that our company’s strategy is paying off. With the capital recently raised we have managed to grow our fleet, substantially increase our profitability and cash flow and create value for our investors. As a result of having acquired six vessels in the course of ten months, we generated net income of $15.5 million in a single quarter which is 15,400% higher than our profit in Q2 22’ and equivalent to 23% of our current market capitalization; We incurred moderate debt during the quarter, maintaining a healthy capital structure with $42.3 million of debt while preserving a free cash balance available for further fleet expansion of about $92 million. Given the strong market fundamentals and the promising charter rate environment and by taking advantage of our efficient management of our expanded fleet, we believe that we will achieve strong results and generate significant cash flow going forward. However, the valuation of our shares of common stock does not reflect our strong financial performance and capital available to fund our growth prospects."	0.6	3	0	3	news	2022-11-04T07:48:46Z	ylq6u3	t3

This carried into the present, where I do the same, but have more money to waste.

Over the past 2 years I've gambled away around 15k into options, which doesn't sound like much, but keep in mind I'm a 19yr old college kid. My gambling addiction from options also led me to get into actual gambling, playing online blackjack and roulette (and of course I lose everything I put into it).

I spend money on almost nothing else but options/gambling. I've put around 20k into other business ventures like game development or e-commerce but I've lost all of that as well because of course those ventures led no-where.

So I am here now, completely broke with a crippling gambling addiction, losing my mind every single night more and more. The only escape I have from this life is the gym, going there almost every day to distract myself from the pure failure I am. 

Feel free to berate and make fun of me, maybe it will give me some motivation to repair my crumbling life."	0.77	79	0	79	meme	2022-11-04T06:20:24Z	ylomx6	t3

wallstreetbets	c0diiii	self.wallstreetbets	8	The Hindenburg Omen - A Indicator Present When Market Conditions Are Ripe For A Crash	"\*\*\*For those of you interested in technical analysis, this post is for you. Before you read the long post, there is a link with a video that is more up to date on market conditions and shows the indicators in action. I thought this was a good topic for a discussion due to current market conditions.\*\*\*

**The Hindenburg Omen** \- A rare market signal with a foreboding name is telling traders to prepare for a possible significant decline. Invoking the memory of the flaming explosion of LZ 129 Hindenburg in 1937. The stock market “Hindenburg Omen” signal plays on images of a monumental disaster.

It is easy to see why many of such observations preceded the **35%** drop in the **S&amp;P 500** in early 2020 – certainly a stock market disaster by any measure. However, when these signals are present, it may be good practice to form an exit strategy and help mitigate any potential losses. Let’s dig into what this indicator is and why its signals are important warnings for precarious market circumstances. 

What is the Hindenburg Omen?

The Hindenburg Omen is a term used in stock trading where certain market conditions align to form a signal. For instance, it’s a warning that conditions are ripe for a steep market decline. 

What are the market conditions to incite this tumble? Look for the following four conditions all occurring on the same day:

* The number of new **NYSE** 52-week highs is greater than **2.8%** of all unchanged issues.
* The number of new **NYSE** 52-week lows is greater than **2.8%** of all unchanged issues.
* The number of new 52-week highs is not more than double the number of new 52-week lows.
* The **NYSE** Composite Index 50-day moving average is rising.

**These first two conditions are the important ones.**

Having a significant number of stocks making new 52-week highs at the same time. While a significant number are making new 52-week lows, signals an unhealthy market. When markets are well-behaved, most stocks tend to move together. When they do not, we should be warned and either readjust or improve our trading discipline. 

\*\*\***That warning puts us on notice that for the subsequent 30 days after any observation, there is a greater than normal chance of a crash on any one of those days where the McClellan oscillator is less than zero.\*\*\***

A Hindenburg Omen in 2022

Market observers saw some signals of another Hindenburg Omen as the markets started to decline in January of 2022. Whether this induces another crash remains to be seen. But it highlights why it is important to keep an eye out for indicators suggesting a crash. Especially in unpredictable markets. They are infrequent, but when they occur, it can give us an early warning to watch for signs that might corroborate a decline.

In late 2021 and again in early 2022, we saw a cluster of Hindenburg Omen observations, as recently as January 14th. That has put us on warning to look for exactly the kind of selling which we have already observed and the potential for even more. On any day when the McClellan oscillator is below zero, down moves could turn ugly.  

This warning sign will remain for a 30-day period from the last observation. When significant selling follows the omen and then turns the 50-day moving average of the **NYSE** composite index down, as it has in early 2022. There cannot be another, fresh Hindenburg observation until the moving average turns back up. Bear markets often begin with attempts to regain a new high which fail. Often this action can set up fresh Hindenburg Omen signals for a subsequent leg down. If markets do bounce, it will be something to watch for.

There are some who say that the Hindenburg, filled with hydrogen, was destined for disaster.  However, the airship traveled ten times from Germany to the United States without incident before the crossing where it burst into flames, and **36%** of those aboard perished.

**Likewise, not every observation of the Omen ends in a stock market disaster. It is, however, a sign of a dangerous condition.**

I found a supporting video that discusses this signal in detail with examples of charts and how you can set it up on our trading platform.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?

  This CHUNKY boy is only going to get chunkier as the boomers get older and older.  Life expectancy is going UP (post-covid) and boomers will become 80 then 90 then 100.  Facebook is going NOWHERE.  All the hipsters say ""Oh I'm going to quit social media,"" but look at how many of your friends actually delete their accounts.  Zuck's got his claws in all of us.

While you think FB is all boomers now, it's only going to increase over the next decade.

Seniors today spend their retirement watching FOX News, and Zuck knows the seniors of tomorrow will sit on FB 12 hour/day DEEP into retirement.

Who's META for?  Not you.  It's for BOOMERS who just had their 2nd knee surgery and can't go to the Louvre in person.  They don't care about gaming, they don't care about graphics.  Zuck is going to mop up all those sweet sweet social security and pension dollars come 2030 and 2040.

When the FB IPO came out \~$40, it dropped to $20 in a few months since people though facebook ran it's course.  That was a decade ago and facebook has done almost nothing to innovate other than buying other companies like whatsapp, insta, etc.  Love it or hate it, facebook/meta is a cash cow and that milk is CHUNKY."	0.6	3	0	3	question	2022-11-04T02:23:48Z	yljpbb	t3
wallstreetbets	Able_Excuse_4456	self.wallstreetbets	14	Learn from my mistakes! (Selling Puts)	"Not looking for advice here, just sharing some lessons that others may benefit.

I've been using equity Options for a couple years to boost yield. Not Robinhood, not even based on WSB, but legitimate income boosting from my own individual research. It started with simple covered Calls, and then I made a few quick bucks with cash-covered Puts. It was some of the easiest money I ever made.

Jim Cramer says that pigs get slaughtered. Unfortunately, I started getting piggish. Jim does have his moments from time to time.

I got a little looser with my Puts, by not having cash to cover in my brokerage account. I have the cash, but it's in Savings. I started making riskier Puts because they had nice premiums. Had to roll a few, even took a few debits, but was overall positive in taking free cash in exchange for a little risk.

My usual tactic was to watch for a symbol to lose 10-20% in a day, wait a day to stabilize, and then sell a Put for another 20% discount. And I'd get 5% annualized yield. They almost always expire harmlessly OTM. Money for nothing. Easy, right?

Some dipped too close for comfort, or even went ITM. No problem, I can roll. Once or twice, I had to open a new nearly-naked Put position to buy out or roll another one. Like paying off a credit card with another credit card. Financial coaches always recommend that kind of behavior, right?

Well, this week, I had 3 of these riskier semi-naked Put positions hit a trifecta. Bad press, bad earnings call, and the Fed Meeting. All 3 plunged 50-80% in days. Far below the Strike. Of the 3, there is really only 1 that I wouldn't mind owning.

Rolling will cost me almost all my gains from the last year, most of which are already invested into other shares that are covering a Call position. So I'll probably have to infuse more cash to buy back or roll at least 2 just to prevent a forced assignment 50% above the share price. Income accounts are meant to withdraw from, not dump more into just to avoid losing even more cash.

Please learn these lessons:

1. Don't sell a Put on a company that you don't want to own.
2. Have the cash in your brokerage to cover it.
3. Don't transact right before Earnings season when it's already a volatile stock.
4. Low volume Options are harder to roll your way out of.
5. Limit your Puts to 1-2 at any given time.
6. Don't be greedy.

Fortunately for me, these are all low dollar mistakes. I set a personal cap at $25 share price to sell a Put, and that saved my hide. Had this happened with high flyers like Meta, I'd be hosed.

Anybody can make easy money once, but the tenth time will bite you bad. Invest wisely."	0.87	22	0	22	loss	2022-11-04T02:19:42Z	yljm1w	t3

Hear me out. FuboTV is reporting earnings tomorrow morning. There's been an uptick on Google searches for Fubo in the past 3 months alongside increased searches in related topics of sports TV subscriptions:

* [https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=%2Fg%2F11c60pfzx6&amp;geo=US](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=%2Fg%2F11c60pfzx6&amp;geo=US)

Compare this to Roku, which did not experience this search uptick. Roku also spent a lot of capital on physical Roku TVs, which the markets punished after its earnings yesterday. Fubo is unburdened by these types of capital expenditures.

* [https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=%2Fm%2F0\_x7l9\_](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=%2Fm%2F0_x7l9_)

Currently, **short interest in FUBO is 24.95%**. With Fubo trading at all time lows, Fubo just has to not report terrible earnings and awful future projections (subscriptions by sports fans are quite resilient to recessions because it's an ""affordable luxury"") for the stock to rally. This domino can lead to a squeeze.

First of Degens I don't like FB which has 2 billion users still a day I also don't care much for mark Z which is either James Halliday  from Ready player one or IOI, I feel its the latter.

https://preview.redd.it/81o9ob4e9tx91.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ec399ad44901de81c8023e2ea495580e954fe9d

\*I don't care for their policies but I do still keep FB because of family and friends, easiest way to find someone, I also Use IG a lot more lately, and whatsapp.

\* I don't care for Z's meta dream currently but I like the cash generating machine and I like todays 2015 valuation. Here is my thesis for long $META.

META dropped -38% in the last 8 days! Which is a +60% upside to OCT 27th prices. I have a feeling funds will be averaging down soon. See charts below.

https://preview.redd.it/wrzy8aklftx91.png?width=1396&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39bfeff5b048823067907033f7fc049ca2535e23

&amp;#x200B;

[META is projected to grow  to record rev in 2023 to 2025 still and just needs to cut spending. ](https://preview.redd.it/yf06wq8patx91.png?width=2110&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01a967cbf7c19800ac2970d23463433cae9e6796)

First of lets talk about why META is down. Obviously when other tech stocks, some of the biggest in the world can drop -20% overnight like AMZN recently did, NFLX -39% overnight it shows we are in one of the most volatile markets ever. Never have we seen such giant market caps drop this much. So this for 1 presents a big opportunity for me.

:Note NFLX has recovered from that -39% overnight drop and is still up 65% since even with the big drop this past week. It recovered 88% in around 4 months time even with the NASDAQ falling -30% since its drop.

https://preview.redd.it/871e3q18ctx91.png?width=1371&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e12efa6bbc5b3e13656784111d463108b1784ec

&amp;#x200B;

The main reason META is down is because of their spending, but many think Meta is spending only on the METAVERSE which is not the case. Their big spending is for the following which will generate record future cash flow with their current ad rev strategy on new platforms.

**Reasons for future Rev growth even in a recession.**

1)Instagram reels fully monetized

2)Whatsapp &amp; Messenger monetization

3) New AI Discovery Engine to make ad targeting more effective with higher average revenue per user.

4) 2.93+ Billion family users fully monetized.

5)An economic downturn recovery &amp; or more spending for ads again.

**Revenue declined slightly because of the following &amp; can rebound quick**

IMO it is Cyclical as number of users are increasing and user time is rising.

1. U.S. Dollar was beating other currencies and Meta gets a lot of ad rev in international markets.
2. A lot of ads from finance have slowed, the highest paying ads, once we sees a rise in market sentiment those ads come back.

3)Instagram and facebook  reels are not being monetized YET which gets 140 BILLION reels played DAILY!, neither is Messenger and Whatsapp.

4)Apples 2021 Privacy changes, Note The New AI discovery engine will fix this for Meta.

5) Mark and management have started record spending currently on infrastructure /AI discovery engine which is what they are spending the most.

6) 2022 expenses $85-87 2023 projected $96 to $101 billion, which Meta can still be cash flow positive but Mark should and could revamp some spending and do this over 2 years vs 1 and the stock could see a massive move up as funds come back.

7) Many funds have far higher averages and IMO could start averaging up.

These funds below have added before the big drop! Algos have likely been selling as well.

https://preview.redd.it/bt0m3axigtx91.png?width=2132&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a82cce52a2e077bf7e6c704278a2e4b463ebda4d

[META is still top 100 revenue generating companies in the entire world ranked at 65 for rev, and 19 out of 7126 for Earnings STILL.](https://preview.redd.it/qbtgcdfdhtx91.png?width=1293&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=863a7752f43c17aea1b9b7d5a40ba6122dc50e3e)

https://preview.redd.it/m8eyumlcjtx91.png?width=1374&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=580994eecdec4c399d2b3772e1f777f973544164

If the meteverse works out this company is projected to 10x to 25x from todays valuations. 236 Billion and could bring in more revenue than the major stocks with massive overheads AMZN WMT etc with META having little overhead.

 Meta has a family of 3 billion users and growing. Starlink from Elon is  helping third world countries get internet and those are new people to  social media. I have a friend a brazilian actress that visited an amazon  tribe and they are using FB and Instagram and especially whatsapp now  on smart phones. Seriously! Billions of more users open up to social  media as Starlink progresses. People only think in their own bubble and  forget there are billions of people that love metas products. 

TLDR: If meta comes out with a revised spending plan the stock could gap up overnight, They could stretch spending over 2 years vs 1. Even if Metaverse does not work out it can easily 3x from here as spending is for AI ad growth with new infrastructure. Funds Should start to average down soon.

Hope you enjoyed this DD. I like buying Undervalued stocks I got in GME at $4.50 and posted here about it. Not saying Meta is going to go up but I am using profits this year to YOLO it.

FYI I currently have 1250 shares so far about $93 average, I have been DCA in. I also have Long call options 500+ various."	0.73	17	0	17	dd	2022-11-04T01:25:01Z	ylid36	t3

# Hedge fund Elliott warns of more pain to come after 2022 market rout

Prominent asset manager says ‘hyperinflation’ could spark one of the worst crises since the second world war

The world is on the road to “hyperinflation” and could be heading towards its worst financial crisis since the second world war, according to Elliott Management, one of the world’s biggest and most influential hedge funds.

The Florida-based firm, which was founded by billionaire Paul Singer and manages about $56bn in assets, has warned its clients of an “extremely challenging” situation for the global economy and for financial markets where investors will find it difficult to make money.

An “extraordinary” set of financial extremes that come as the era of cheap money draws to a close “have made possible a set of outcomes that would be at or beyond the boundaries of the entire post-WWII period,” it wrote in the letter, which was seen by the Financial Times.

“Investors should not assume they have ‘seen everything’” just because they have experienced financial crises such as the 1970s bear market and oil price shock, the 1987 market crash, the dotcom bust or the 2008 financial crisis, it added.

Elliott declined to comment.

The group’s warning comes during a dismal year for markets, in which global equities have shed $28tn in value, according to Bloomberg data, and bonds have also tumbled, leaving investors with few places to seek shelter.

The fund manager laid much of the blame for the looming crisis on central bank policymakers, which it said had been “dishonest” about the causes of high inflation by blaming it on supply chain bottlenecks in the wake of the pandemic, rather than on ultra-loose monetary policy put in place at the height of the coronavirus crisis in 2020.

The world is “on the path to hyperinflation”, it said, which could lead to “global societal collapse and civil or international strife”. While such an outcome is not certain, this is currently the direction that the world was headed, it added.

Its warnings come as investors try to assess the economic damage likely to be felt from a rapid series of large interest rate increases in the US and elsewhere, as central bankers race to try to curb soaring inflation.

The S&amp;P has dropped 20 per cent since its peak at the start of this year, while the Nasdaq is down by one-third since its high a year ago.

However, Elliott said markets had not fallen far enough, given the many risks present, and warned of a further reversal of the so-called ‘everything rally’ seen near the top of the bull market of recent years, as sky-high investor exuberance lifted all manner of risky assets.

There are so many “frightening and seriously negative possibilities” that it is hard not to think that “a seriously adverse unwind of the everything bubble” is coming, it said.

The hedge fund estimates a 50 per cent fall from peak to trough would be “normal”, suggesting further large falls to come in major equity markets, although it added it was impossible to know whether or when that would happen.

Elliott, which is up 6.4 per cent in 2022 and which has only lost money in two calendar years since launch in 1977, pointed to a handful of areas of potential stress that could accelerate market falls. It highlighted banks’ losses on bridge financing, potential markdowns of collateralised loan obligations and leveraged private equity as areas of potential risk for markets.

The firm was also critical of investors who believed market falls will always prove shortlived and can be “ignored”.

The idea that “‘we will not panic because we have seen this before’ does not comport with the current facts”, it said."	0.76	53	0	53	chart	2022-11-04T00:53:12Z	ylhggj	t3

If you are a non-virgin, you understand that the sole purpose for investing and trading is to generate returns, to increase the NAV of your brokerage account and to push your net worth in the upward direction. Why? Because it feels good to have the monetary freedom to do whatever the fuck you want, because green GAIN porn is better than red loss porn, and because it is better to look at your account balance and smile instead of twitch in misery. You are here to make money. You are not here to “be right,” — you are here to generate returns, and preferably, returns in excess of the market, in so much excess of the SPY that you are catapulted towards massive capital appreciation (meaningful tendies) before age 80.

The challenge obviously is that it’s extremely fucking difficult to extract money from the markets, especially with an appropriate level of risk. Unless you are a boomer investing with a 50 year horizon, the markets are designed to fuck you over. Markets are difficult and good opportunities are scarce, especially in a bear market environment like we’ve seen YTD. But remember Warren Buffet said “be something when others are something”? Yes, and today is your opportunity.

Right now, an asymmetrical risk-reward investment window is present in ASTS, a company called AST SpaceMobile, where (i) the disruptive technology and scalable commercialization plan are set to create immense value in the coming months, years and decades, (ii) the macro environment allows for a chance to get in *early* into a potential “millionaire maker” name like NVDA or TSLA, and (iii) a contrarian and concentrated bet can provide incredible upside with manageable level of risk.

I am going to spare you impatient people who are already desperately looking for a TLDR from the “generational opportunity” technical thesis but instead show you the swing TRADE SETUP in ASTS that in my mind has a chance of printing money in the next few weeks and months. Three factors: (1) three meaningful catalysts in mid November, (2) continued business plan execution updates, (3) forces from market participants, potentially with better macro tailwinds, could make the ASTS stock spike, consolidate and push upward in a staircase pattern to high levels. Read on.

# 2/ The Background and the Backers

Notwithstanding the fact that Cathie Wood is washed up, disruptive technology wins in the long-term. Not Roku or Zoom but TRUE innovation that propels humankind forward. ASTS pushes forward that kind of technology, aiming to become the first comprehensive space-based cellular service provider, bridging the connectivity gap across the globe by providing high speed internet access to billions of unconnected people, and powering billions of others who move in and out of coverage even in developed markets like the US.

ASTS is launching a network of satellites to provide these services to any mobile device on the planet. That is achieved through deploying and operating satellite “cell towers” in orbit that will cover the entire Earth with 4G / 5G / LTE signal. The technology links directly to any unmodified smartphone, and unlike Starlink, doesn’t require any additional hardware. This monumental step forward in global connectivity is done through launching proprietary 168 BlueBird satellites into orbit and beaming signal through ASTS patented technology.

All sounds dreamy but this achievement means little for ASTS stock without a solid plan for commercialization. ASTS monetizes the technology through B2B revenue sharing agreements with existing global MNOs like AT&amp;T or Vodafone, who already back the company and even have repeated investments in ASTS. These profit sharing mechanisms effectively remove any customer acquisition or CRM costs for ASTS, and open the opportunity for fat free cash flow margins (Transhumanica thinks 90%+ EBITDA margins) after the network is operational.

Right now, ASTS is on path for business plan execution with one of the main hurdles, having the first BlueWalker 3 satellite in space, already complete in September. The BlueWalker 3 is now orbiting Earth at 17,000 mph and is ready to start “unfurling” on November 10th with testing shortly thereafter.

[BlueWalker 3 satellite and the ASTS team](https://preview.redd.it/33cpnveensx91.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7059c581f68dd7f8adb8bb5663bea60f99ba61e1)

The TEAM: Abel Avellan, Rakuten, Invesat, Vodafone, AMERICAN TOWER corporation.

The guy in charge, the CEO is Abel Avellan. A chad who was founder of another satellite-based communications company EMC that he sold for $550M in July 2016, using proceeds for initial funding of ASTS. He is executing on the business plan with skin in the game with 78M shares (\~$500M currently) and majority of his networth tied in ASTS shares.

Other direct backers that have stakes include **Rakuten, Invesat, Vodafone and American Tower Corporation**. On top of that ASTS has partnerships and conversations with multiple MNOs in different jurisdictions to provide their service through the B2B revenue sharing model once satellites are operational. Quick cap table. Total shares outstanding 183.0M from 10Q as of August 5, 2022.

The BELIEVERS:

* Rakuten, American Tower, Vodafone (along w Samsung) did ASTS Series B then PIPE ($230M) investments.
* Mikitani Hiroshi is billionaire Rakuten CEO backing ASTS with a massive stake.
* Transhumanica with a detailed research paper that I highly recommend. They have an interactive valuation model with a $114 current PT.
* BRiley equity research has outstanding $15 PT.
* DB equity research has outstanding $30 PT.
* Barclays equity research has outstanding $15 PT.
* Also people on the ASTS subreddit have provided incredibly detailed research on the technology and the company.

The NON-BELIEVERS:

* Kerrisdale Capital released some bearish seller research if you’re interested in reading a negative scenario case.

# 3/ The Astrology and the Price

As a former SPAC, ASTS first got attention in late 2020 and participated in the high-growth mania of that period, reaching a peak price of over $25 in February 2021. To me, that price action is of little significance as it was fueled by an incredible frenzy in overall markets, which soon deflated and normalized later in the year. The company de-SPACed in April 2021. Since then, ASTS displayed remarkable resilience despite being a high-growth, unprofitable company in a very punishing macro environment, where rising interest rates have caused the valuation DCF discount rates to go up, valuation multiples to go down, acutely hurting stocks that have more expected FCF value in the future.

The market is a mystery and it can price something far from true value for a long time. It’s hard to value ASTS as most cash flow is in the future. To me, if execution is good, I’d just do $5B EBITDA in 2026 and 8x multiple, discounted to today at 20% – we’d see $100+ per share valuation. Of course it’s a bit binary so we have to be aware of the downside risks with execution at zero. Nevertheless the equity research people are bullish including Deutsche Bank, Barclays, BRiley. You can also take a look at numbers at Transhumanica or peruse through spacanpanman’s Twitter with more research and projections summarized neatly.

Deutsche Bank note from August when ASTS spiked on BlueWalker news:

[Deutsche Bank comment](https://preview.redd.it/ntirufb0osx91.png?width=992&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2800afe12df4affb7e6f9bd89f88f695ab84b4e5)

Interestingly, from June 1, 2022 to present the daily return correlation between ASTS and SPY/QQQ has been remarkably low at around 0.38, which I view as a good thing. Less dependent on daily volatility BS from indexes.

ASTS has traded in a huge channel from the lows of $5.50 to the highs of $14.00 since March 2021 to present. Previous multi-year stock “winners” they all came out of incredibly long consolidation bases which we observe here.

[ TradingView chart of ASTS, 1W ](https://preview.redd.it/dliwwerfqsx91.png?width=1813&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f0034d94a9bd64156001576681377529e74819c)

ASTS year-to-date performance as of October 26 is around -22.8%, compared to the QQQ -34.3%. For a high growth stock, it shows incredible strength — compare it with names like ARKK that are down -62.0% YTD, big dog ABNB -45.2% and SNOW -53.8%. This relative strength gives an indication that despite being currently unprofitable ASTS is likely going to be a leader going forward. Strong stocks are often future winners.

Pretty much from early July to mid-August the indexes grinded higher with QQQ up around 20% — during that time ASTS consolidated in a narrow range. After a few catalysts and good reports in early August, ASTS jumped from around $6.5 to around $14 in a matter of a few weeks. At $14 supply zone, the price action slowed and got slammed down with the overall market and sellers, pushing it down with more inflation worries and higher interest rates woes.

Now we are back at the “support” or demand area, at so-called lows where risk-to-reward becomes super attractive.

# 4/ The Dangers of a Bearish Trade and Previous Catalysts

The no-brainer trade this year was to short unprofitable technology and do nothing but watch how the overall market punishes those stocks. That was the “easy” trade on a company like ASTS that sellers capitalized on. The downward adjustment of multiples due to higher interest rates pushed DCF valuation models lower and ASTS price has been sinking. Naturally, sellers use the opportunity to profit from a structural decline where not much can be done really, the tide goes down and takes every ship down with it. BUT, this can be dangerous when a company is executing on the business plan and has positive developments.

This year we had 2 catalysts that showed what can happen when ASTS keeps executing on the business plan.

1. On March 9, 2022 the news came out that ASTS partnered with SpaceX to deliver their satellites to space. That proved ASTS is meaningfully moving forward with its objectives, and resulted in a ferocious seller covering rally that day, where just “riding with tide” as a seller backfired massively. ASTS stock almost doubled in a day: from lows of $6.20 to highs of $11.40. Later, macro pressures set in again, pushing ASTS lower and the “easy” bear trade came back in, sinking all high risk assets.
2. On July 28, 2022 yet another positive news momentum came in with BW3 satellite launch, that forced a lot of sellers to get out of the way. The frenzied rally more than doubled the stock price in a few weeks. Price went from $6.20 to $14.20, then received expected push back and yielded with broad market weakness.

After Kerrisdale released their bearish report in mid-September price nose dived and we visited the $6 “support area” and bottom of the channel. Interesting to note that previous 2 times, the stock launched from around $6.20.

I think right now there is little idiosyncratic movement to the stock, mostly macro pushing it lower, but that is about to change. Now is an optimal time to get in because we are the bottom of the channel and 3 massive catalysts are upcoming next week, hopefully aided by the tailwinds from macro (not guaranteed) and pressures from sellers relenting as company executes.

# 5/ The New LONG Trade and Upcoming Catalysts

We have an ER update call on Monday, November 14. The three main events will serve as proof of company execution and are likely to push the price up in the next few weeks.

1. Unfurling of the BW3 satellite is going to happen on November 10. Successful completion is likely to serve as a big catalyst to the stock. Satellite will open up and become operational and ready for testing.

[Furled](https://preview.redd.it/5y3wecosqsx91.png?width=643&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd2ae1d0649d74a9db5fe749c1856a6d70bd0d6e)

[Unfurled](https://preview.redd.it/ew43yfytqsx91.png?width=651&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=916c4d08e26af04ecfd10f47c8a29ee23fe2dce1)

2. Testing of the satellite should happen shortly thereafter and an announcement confirmation of working technology is going to be an even larger event for ASTS. This will be the proof that technology works with MNOs.

3. Other funding or partnership updates, like 5G Fund providing indication of possible financing to ASTS may happen by the end of the year, as well as getting licenses in new jurisdictions (Japan), or more partnerships with MNOs.

[Comments on ASTS eligibility for being financed by FCC's 5G Fund](https://preview.redd.it/g1iknnuvqsx91.png?width=1093&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83b7a48437c40c0dc87d4b6a3f9a2ab964afeb4f)

One of the arguments of sellers is that company will need additional funding before generating meaningful free cash flow. Currently they do have runway to revenue, and that gets even better if the FCC 5G fund awards capital to ASTS or if price stays at $18+ for a month, where warrants become redeemable for $200M of capital. Moreover, there’s other non-dilutive financing options, but regardless I think they’ll be explored in second half of 2023 or later.

&amp;#x200B;

[From spacanpanman](https://preview.redd.it/co5m5bc0rsx91.png?width=1194&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a1991c6fc6b4ae4c8fef5e73a7840c35434eeac)

The reason why I think the moves up on positive news could be violent is because there will be additional buying pressure from bearish traders to get cover their positions in face of good data.

Once ASTS confirms that these events are successful, stock will likely become favored by passive and risk-averse investors, with institutional funds buying in and momentum/breakout traders scaling into positions. I believe we’ll get to $14 area if updates are positive, and a breakout above that is likely to clean the path to $18+ which I think is going to be the turning point for the company, that will set it up for long term success.

[ASTS 1D timeframe, imaginary price action.](https://preview.redd.it/wrcwev02ssx91.png?width=1814&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c19d086660cb232eff0c4b823b17f25bc91d5f2d)

Disclaimer, Risks:

Past performance is not indicative of future results. This is not financial advice. There are risks of company failing and stock going to zero.

TLDR:

The no brainer trade this year was to short unprofitable technology and just sit tight. But it is dangerous now, especially on a company like ASTS, which is a powder keg that can explode on successful business developments that are to be announced on November 10 and shortly after. Three upcoming catalysts are likely to serve as a repeat of price action in March and August. Although price is artificially suppressed by the macro environment, once that pressure subsides, the stock will stay high and keep pushing forward as company executes.

After a pretty exciting pre market with how red we opened (bless up for my over night puts) we after the first 45 minutes of the day held the same about $3 range all day long. With a love volume red day it seems there is a lot of sidelines money right now and we could end up seeing buyers step back in. I am cautiously optimistic for tomorrow bull wise though. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/un24xy0nrsx91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f21e31cb538ba7322c65e8041bc1f095f301074b

The biggest thing that I mentioned bear wise that happened yesterday was that we broke through key 378 support (green channel). I had mentioned that 370.5 was another big area. I highlighted it here to make it a little more clear. You can see that there is a clear resistance/ support line right there. With SPY breaking through and then holding over it all day and closing over it today I am actually looking for an upside resistance test. 

SPY has put in 4 red days in a row now so it could be expected we get a green day. The other oddity to say the least is that SPY closed down -1.02% and the VIX also closed down -2.28%. Usually I would say that doesn’t happen but in 2022 and lately its happening more and more. Despite everything the JPOW said yesterday the fear isn’t rising in the markets. This is either  sign by the VIX that we should continue to be bullish and expect upside or this is a really “cheap” opportunity to buy some longer DTE puts. 

Bulls will want to defend 370.5 tomorrow again and more or less leave it in the dust and completely gap fill 374.76 tomorrow. From there they need to retest the 378 resistance line and attempt to break back into that zone. 

Bears will want to finally take out 370.5 and close below it with hopes of testing 365 to 359.9 tomorrow and into next week. This is the first time we have had a full candle close below the daily 8ema since before CPI. 

Key support- 370.5 -&gt; 365 -&gt; 359.9

Key resistance- 374.6 -&gt; 378

Looking at futures we nicely held resistance at 3770 and were not quite able to break through support at 3705. Bulls will look to retake 3770 and possibly key 3805 tomorrow. 

Bears will look to continue the sell off and seek out 3705 and most importantly 3675 support.

Apple looked incredibly heavy compared to the rest of the market and actually was the worst top 10 ticker of the day just barely beating out Google. Interestingly enough Apple is only $3 away from its after hours low of 136 on earnings day. 

Now that Apple is back at the 138.2 support area this is where we can look for it to bounce if it is going to bounce. However, something to keep in mind is that unlike tesla and other stocks Apple has NOT put in its 2nd 52week low… this very well could be its attempt at doing so. 

We have a nice black downward channel inside of a falling wedge that also have a falling wedge inside of the black channel… lol yes I know right? 

Key support- 138.2 -&gt; 135 -&gt; 130

Tesla continues to be all over the place. We did see it break through that “mid” point of 215 today however it was able to find support nicely at 210. However, it did break through the 2 day drop resistance line it was not able to break through and take out the daily 8ema this morning and had a pretty strong rejection there. I will be looking to see if Tesla finds support here with this doji on a downrend which can lead to an upside recovery or if it will indeed retest 205.6 support tomorrow. 

Key support- 214.9 -&gt; 210 -&gt; 205.6

The VIX just absolutely continues to unwind here and doesn’t seem to be phased by anything at all anymore. What will cause the VIX to spike and revery back to the 28-30+ range? Honestly im not sure at this point. The really only big bear event ahead is CPI next Thursday but besides that we have nothing till December. December actually is doing to be a Doozy with CPI on a Tuesday immediately followed the next day by FOMC. 

This CPI still does not have a consensus out… which gives me the same type of vibes from last September CPI which could result in a bigger sell off again. I wouldnt be surprised to see a short rally tomorrow till next week. Markets are looking for that “oh wow yeah lets sell” reason again and I don’t forsee one till CPI. CPI most likely will miss and that’s where it gets complicated. On one hand we know jpow said he isn’t ready to slow or pause… he said inflation aint fixed… so another bad CPI maybe he rockets a 100bps at us? Definitely another 75bps at us… how will markets react? Will we react like September or will we react like October.

We also get to add in the unemployment rate to the mix tomorrow if you remember last month when this hit we had an incredibly red open when this news hits the market.

BOE has mentioned Russia's invasion as the cause of inflation in half their bullet points. [(source)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug4qOZ_ZGus)

BOE knew this was going to happen. They forewarned their citizens of electricity and gas shortages last year before the war broke out.

And not just BOE, the FED has also mentioned the war as a leading factor. [(source)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT2H9iyd-ms)

IF true, and a big if.

Putin's course of action is to play the war out as long as possible win or lose irrelevant, as along as it provide an excuse to bomb pipelines (DONE), and participate in predatory market practices (DONE), and break economic agreements (DONE). Russia doesn't need boots on American soil when he can simply have the central banks do the job for him.

This is a well played out market manipulation on the futures markets and he's causing ripples across the globe and to Russia's benefit.

"There is a stock I like from an EV company I believe they have a decent chance of being a hit within the next few years. Using round numbers if the stock is at $2 and there are 300 million shares.  
If they plan on adding another 100 million shares what is the math to figure out if I messed up or not?
At what value does the stock need to be in 2 years for this to have been a good idea?  
This is a stock I plan on holding onto with hopes that it is a good long term investment. Should I buy know when I can now or is the smart move to wait after the extra shares are released and maybe pay more per share?

Edit:  Thanks for the help everyone. I slightly understand this more. At least well enough to know this its not really a math problem.

wallstreetbets	predictany007	self.wallstreetbets	10	Netflix ad tier debuts at 'a pivotal moment for the industry,' ad exec explains	"Netflix's (NFLX) ad-supported tier officially arrives in the United States on Thursday.

The ad plan, dubbed ""Basic with Ads,"" will cost $6.99 a month in the U.S. — just below Disney's ad-based price point of $7.99 (which will roll out on December 8.)

""Basic with Ads"" will complement Netflix's existing ad-free tiers and be available in 12 countries, including the U.S., the U.K., Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, and Spain.

The ad tier will feature an average of 4-to-5 minutes of ads per hour. At launch, ads will run 15 or 30 seconds in length, with some running prior to the start of a program while others will be mid-roll ads.

Wall Street analysts are largely bullish on the profitability aspects of the new ad tier, and advertising experts refer to the debut as a make-or-break moment for the media industry.

""It is absolutely a pivotal moment for the industry,"" Kevin Krim, CEO of advertising measurement platform EDO, told Yahoo Finance, citing Amazon's (AMZN) Thursday Night Football as another watershed moment when streaming, subscription, and ad-supported went to the masses.

Looking back, the executive explained, this ""will be the moment where the vast majority of Americans became crystal clear that there's going to be a new way to get the must-watch TV that they care about — and it's going to be through a subscription-based and an ad-supported business model.""

Amid concerns that Netflix subscribers will trade down to the ad-supported version, Citi Managing Director Jason Bazinet previously told Yahoo Finance Live that he views the introduction of advertising as a lucrative revenue driver.

""It's not a spin down risk — it's a spin up opportunity,"" the analyst maintained, estimating that the company could secure $10 or more in advertising revenue per ad-tier subscriber in the U.S.

wallstreetbets	han_bylo	self.wallstreetbets	19	$CANO is severely underpriced, prove me wrong	"Hello fellow regards,

Based on me being 15% down on my position (7000 shares @ $4.02) and the 2 hours (maybe 1.5) of ""research"" I've done, I have concluded that this stock is underpriced.

The stock is reeling from the news that CVS has likely pulled a purchase offer, but it seems like everyone has forgotten that Humana $HUM is still looking to buy, always had right of first refusal, and is primed to purchase (still up 30% on the year). Both CVS and Humana are desperate to get more of that Medicare Advantage plan money and are basically fighting to buy the company. CVS reportedly stated in their conference call that they are still looking to get into primary care through acquisitions, and failed on their attempt to purchase One Medical who was instead bought by Amazon. Meaning the ""news"" of their pullout is likely bullshit to get $CANO back on sale for the institutions before the actual buyout. Not to mention the market cap of CANO is $1 billion less than the enterprise value (whatever that means, it seems good). Analyst's lowest forecast is $4.04, still giving this an %18 upside worst case scenario and a buyout could reasonably drive this to $12 if not higher. 

In summation, $CANO is an opportunity for free money."	0.55	2	0	2	dd	2022-11-03T18:41:17Z	yl7kw5	t3

wallstreetbets	mojolakota	self.wallstreetbets	31	My message to Powell: Higher rates will lead to higher inflation, ironically. Let me explain my theory on profit vs debt	"It’s counter intuitive but many companies don’t want to make profit these days. There are many problems with being profitable. First you have to pay tax on profits. Second making profit is actually difficult. Third if you start to make profit it will never be enough for the market and you can’t sell a story of hyper growth company to pump your stocks.

What companies really wanted is asset appreciation whether it be their stocks or real estate. In world of money printing, cheap debt and fiat system, most asset values always go up in price over time. 

Appreciating assets allows businesses to cash out refinance at lower rates. Unlike profit, this borrowed money is tax free as per IRS. The tax free borrowed money is then used to boost revenues through ads, pump stocks thru buybacks &amp; sustain lifestyle of executives and their sugar babies. 

The ponzi continues because some of the borrowed money is used to pump the asset prices. Declining rates help as well. As the debt servicing costs decline it boosts the asset prices allowing businesses to get new round of cash out refinance, pay down smaller debt with bigger debt and continue the ponzi.

Powell grew up in different world where companies actually relied on profits for their liquidity. Not anymore. Business models rely heavily on cheap debt these days. In fact they prefer tax free cheap debt over taxable profits which requires running an efficient business and not just financial engineering.

Powell doesn’t understand simple fact it was the declining rates of last 40 years and access to tax free cheap debt that provided liquidity to businesses and also allowed them to keep prices low for their consumers and inflation in check. 

Ironically declining rates will reduce inflation and increasing rates will increase inflation"	0.28	0	0	0	question	2022-11-03T18:10:44Z	yl6u9l	t3

I averaged down nicely on my initial TWLO position.  
The spreads are wide, so it is taking me a while to get my fills.

Depending on what happens near EOD, I'll either add more calls to DKNG or open a very large short sell position on TWLO to offset IV crush and theta (if the stock goes down that is).

LUMN got killed on their earnings and I'm familiar with TWLO since I've traded them to a 6 figure loss at the peak of the pandemic.

Full disclosure, I am down 780K on the 1 year chart.  
Follow me for more FD plays and financial/investing advice.

EDIT 3:44PM EST.  
I closed out my DKNG play.  
Now I'm short -2,787 shares of TWLO, about \~184K

[Never have I been so bearish about a stock. I'm even more bearish than when I made my META\/ABNB play.](https://preview.redd.it/6pbipx9zhsx91.png?width=1164&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd662918f4d5ece0324eba951f66b8f9cf19474f)

I expect TWLO to drop 20% at a minimum, they're a garbage company.  
Iron hands ftw.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT 2 6:34PM EST.  
I bought back my 2787 short shares.  
Average sell = \~66.11  
Average buy = \~54.25

This is approximately an \~18% gain, about 33K in profits.  
I'll post a separate gain for my puts.

Somebody came along and put brand new siding on it. They also put brand new roof on it. Put new windows in. And made the grounds look really good. Then they decided to add new levels to it. This can only lead to a collapse. The foundation can't support what they keep putting on top. The best bet is an intentional tear down to rebuild. Or we can pursue the course that 80% of you want to take. To continue to build until it collapses without warning.	0.79	17	0	17	question	2022-11-03T17:23:13Z	yl5mcq	t3
wallstreetbets	cougar02	self.wallstreetbets	4	Using Macro-Economic factors to generate profit on AT&amp;T calls.	The basis behind this investment is as follows. AT&amp;T is the most indebted company on the market, with this being said the increased rates have put increased pressure on AT&amp;T to reduce their debt to lower the debt service the must pay. I believe that this increased interest rate risk has already been priced in.  My theory is that there is significant value that has yet to be priced into the options chain because there is a significant underestimation as to how much the prices will be positively affected when the lowering of rates is announced and when it occurs. So I with this being said I am currently holding 3 calls that expire April 2023. If the lowering rates announcement does not come by April I am going to roll my calls further out and play the waiting game. If you have any thoughts about this idea please let me know.	0.5	0	0	0	dd	2022-11-03T17:22:35Z	yl5lui	t3

TWLO: Twilio, shit company, they've been making gay bears cum for the past year and a half. Their ""guidance"" is that their EPS is going to be twice as low as last qtr (-.215 vs. -.4)I think they are going to do the same this evening after earnings. All of the ""analysts"" that post their predictions on Bloomberg and are bullish have a 1yr return of around -77%... That's Cramer in my eyes and I'm going to inverse that shit. However, looking at the options chain, there has been a huge influx of calls over the past day. Will check later to see how the sentiment goes.

PYPL: Paypal, also making the bears horny and proud. Bullish ""analysts"" have also been losing like a degen here, averaging around -65%. I'm planning on inversing these ""professionals"" as well. I see an influx of puts here and have gone ahead and bought puts myself, will adjust near market close.  
Positions: 5x PYPL 4Nov $72p

SQ: I think SQ is the worst among these so call ""pro analysts"". Those who are bullish average around -78% for the past year! I expect to buy puts, but the options chain has no huge skew. Will check later and open position.

SBUX: The only positive one here. SBUX seems to be making money. Analysts are bullish and have decent returns. I am also seeing a nice amount of new OI on calls. Will check later and open position.

There you go, my fellow crayon munchers. Will update y'all on my final positions. My apologies for not posting the most active options lately, but I have been caught up with earning calls! We'll see if I go vroom vroom in a Lambo or be sucking on some weiners behind your local Wendy's dumpster!"	0.91	9	0	9	dd	2022-11-03T17:18:37Z	yl5id3	t3

I try to have the same mindset that I had during this last bull run what will be the future now where can I risk my money on a future gamble, and this seems like it can be the future, Meta has tons of more cash to throw at this and the engineers.

* Shares of Airbnb fell more than 13% Wednesday, a day after the company released third-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street’s estimates but fell short on fourth-quarter guidance.
* For the fourth quarter, Airbnb said it expects to deliver between $1.80 billion and $1.88 billion, below the midpoint of $1.85 billion as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.

Shares of Airbnb fell more than 13% Wednesday, a day after the company released third-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street’s estimates but fell short on fourth-quarter guidance.

Airbnb beat on top and bottom lines in its third quarter. The company posted revenue of $2.9 billion, up 29% year-over-year for its strongest quarter ever, and topped analysts’ estimates of $2.8 billion, according to Refinitiv. The revenue increase was driven by stable growth in the Nights and Experiences booked and elevated average daily rates.

But Airbnb provided fourth-quarter revenue guidance of $1.80 billion and $1.88 billion, below the midpoint of $1.85 billion as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.

Airbnb said to “expect a continued, albeit choppy, recovery of cross-border travel to be a further tailwind to future results” as countries around the world continue to recover from Covid lockdowns and grapple with high levels of inflation and rising interest rates.

wallstreetbets	predictany007	self.wallstreetbets	4	Guggenheim downgrades Roku, citing warning signs after latest quarterly report	"Analyst Michael Morris downgraded the television streaming stock to neutral from buy and removed his price target on the name. He previously had a target of $70 per share on Roku.

“We believe in the long-term opportunity for CTV and see Roku’s active account base and operating assets as valuable,” he said in a note to clients, referencing the app CTV that allows users to watch TV. “However, we struggle to value the business given the lack of detail from the company and the warning indicators.”

On Wednesday, the company issued fourth-quarter revenue guidance that was well below expectations, along with a larger-than-expected adjusted EBITDA forecast. Roku did reported a smaller-than-expected loss for the third quarter, but Morris noted those expectations were already slashed as the business has suffered.

He called the fourth-quarter guidance the “primary surprise,” noting it was “well below” prior forecasts and implied revenue declines due to a drop in up-front spending from advertisers. But he still expects the company to beat when reporting fourth-quarter earnings.

Fourth-quarter total net revenue guidance was predicted by Guggenheim to be 1% lower than the same quarter a year ago. The firm previously expected it to grow 4% in the quarter. Ad revenue is expected to decline 5% in the quarter after being forecast to grow by 7%, while total platform revenue should grow 0.5% compared to the 6% growth expected before the earnings call.

Morris said there is concern over the magnitude of the soft cyclical environments impact on advertising space not bought at the “upfront” event.

Meanwhile, he said the company is still operating at a loss and is likely to increase spending if conditions improve. He also pointed to what he called a lack of visibility into the company’s business drivers such as advertising revenue trends, investment goals and profitability objectives that make it hard to predict future performance.

The stock plummeted 19% in premarket trading following the earnings release Wednesday. Roku has taken a beating this year, losing more than 76.2% through Wednesday’s close.

Guggenheim downgraded its ratings for Roku (ROKU) despite the company reported better-than-expected revenue and a larger-than-expected number of active accounts, however, issued fourth-quarter revenue guidance that was below expectations.

On Nov. 1st, Uber reported better-than-expected quarterly results. It reported an adjusted loss of 61 cents a share on revenue of $8.34 billion. Analysts expected Uber to report a loss of 18 cents a share on revenue of $8.1 billion. 

Uber's total gross bookings were $29.12 billion, slightly below expectations of $29.67 billion. But the company expects total fourth-quarter bookings to rise 23% to 27% from a year earlier. Uber also gave its fourth-quarter profit before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) guidance range of $600 million to $630 million. Wall Street was expecting $567 million.

CEO Dara Khosrowshahi gives the impression in a statement Tuesday, saying the company delivered a ""strong quarter” and is “well positioned to deliver expanded profitability in the coming quarters.”

Meanwhile, UBER also sees positive comments from Evercore ISI’s Tech analyst Mark Mahaney and Wedbush’s analyst Dan Ives. According to Mark Mahaney, Uber is part of the $2 trillion global ride-sharing and delivery market. He thinks the company is on track to grow bookings by about 30% from its current 90 million customers.

""Uber is continuing to see healthy growth as the driver shortage is essentially over while the company continues to benefit from travel returning, shifting to the office, as other post-pandemic trends continue to hold globally with Uber poised to benefit into 2023,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to clients.

You also need a disinterested and independent board committee, and a more formalized process, which wasn’t followed here.

A friend once said and i paraphrase ' The techs can not rise unless the semis get bullish 'i sure hope this is the beginning of the Rally to 4200-4500 we keep hearing about .i made a lot of money in semis the last three weeks but perhaps i took profits too early. A volatile lot to be sure and i don't own at present . If the broader market stays bullish i will buy back on a dip . Need to see strength from other techs first.   


i called this Q4 semi rally way back in early October and the Semis bottomed on October 13th . So i feel like the Semi sector now needs the rest of the tech market to participate in order for a post mid term rally to materialize .   


having said that, i think the market typically rallies 16% on the following 12 months post midterms so its a now or never event just in front of us.   


best wishes to all and i hope i have helped some of us make money. 

&amp;#x200B;

Next sector that you may want to explore is :  Sector(s): Communication Services  
Industry: Entertainment 

&amp;#x200B;

There are some highly profitable  companies in that sector with multiple compressions i have not seen in a three years or so.  Deep value with decent subscriber growth and consistently profitable.

many of those stocks in that sector will put on a strong rebound."	1	1	0	1	question	2022-11-05T15:27:45Z	ymtxhj	t3

# Friday’s Price Action

SPY pushed down at open, slipping through the AVWAP. We bounced around 372, slipped over and established support at AVWAP. We hit a failure swing on the RSI and pushed upwards to 380 ish resistance. At 380 ish, we pushed a tad higher as we hit a double top on the 2m RSI. We reversed and re-tested AVWAP, making a few failure swings along the way. We hit over half measure on the rising wedge and bottomed at 370. Spy then traded in a rectangle pattern for the next 2h 40m. During this time, we made a bullish divergence. We broke out of rectangle at 12:42 UTC-6 and headed to HOD. Near close, as we made higher highs, a bearish divergence printed. It will be interesting to see how that plays out in PM if at all.

# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

Stocks rose as traders weighed mixed job data and awaited next week's inflation data for more clues on when the Federal Reserve might be able to slow its rate hike pace.

  
The S&amp;P 500 has ended a four-day decline. The dollar has dropped to its lowest level since March 2020. Two-year US yields have reversed course and fallen.

  
Fed Fund Futures are pricing a 50-basis-point increase in December, but rates are expected to peak around 5.1% next year. Officials raised rates by 75 basis points this week for the fourth time in a row, bringing their benchmark to a target range of 3.75% to 4%.

  
This year, the S&amp;P 500 has already seen five monthly moves of more than 7%, either up or down. Beyond the tumult of the 2008 global financial crisis, more swings of this magnitude in a single year can be found in 1933, during the Great Depression.

  
The latest US inflation reading is expected on Thursday, after the core consumer price index rose more than expected to a 40-year high in September. Even if prices begin to fall, the CPI remains well above the Fed's comfort level.

We are really at a pivotal point here. We hit a double top on the daily RSI on Friday of last week and are at a point where we could see a failure swing or uptrend continuation based on bullish divergence. Next week will be important as we wait for CPI reading on Thursday.

Then, 2022 happened…

Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you already know how hard this year has been.

Internet coins are not safe.

Stocks are not safe.

Real Estate is a bubble.

And inflation is eating the dollar.

So, how does one make money investing in this bear market?

Well, I am going to be detailing my options swing trading strategy, and I’ll use some real life examples of trades I’ve done over the last few weeks.

**This is the exact strategy I used to find:**

A 13% ROKU Short

https://preview.redd.it/enanllscl5y91.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa124f4f7355b604bc2d3363a0404e83f594ab30

A 14% OXY long

And more…

The best part is that these returns happen fast. All within 1–2 weeks

These percentages might not be very impressive, but we can make these returns exponentially higher using options.

Now, without further ado, let’s discuss…

# How To Find Trades

I use a strategy called The Strat. The Strat was invented by Rob Smith.

I won’t go into much detail on The Strat. If you want to learn more about it, check out [this link.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VqJmwZ43r0_7vfjxqUnsaOlbtpBFrKHL6FoSb_qYBoc/edit)

I'll just show you the basics.

When it comes to chart candlesticks, there are only 3 possible scenarios:

## Scenario 1: An inside bar

**Scenario 2: A directional bar**

Please excuse my not so great picture. A directional bar is a bar that only breaks one side of the previous bar. If it breaks the previous bar to the upside, we call it a 2U and if it breaks the previous bar to the downside, we call it a 2D.

## Scenario 3: An outside bar

https://preview.redd.it/472rjeurl5y91.png?width=367&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a697e35ae60eda14b4795bf1b2e4836246c0bf40

An outside bar is a bar that breaks both the upside and the downside of the previous bar.

## My Setups

I find setups based on the weekly chart using [Runstrat.com](http://runstrat.com/) as a scanner (it’s free), and filter for reversals.

I’m looking for either a red 2U candle or a shooter candle for a potential short position, and a green 2D or hammer candle for a potential long position.

Here are some pictures, so you can visualize the setups:

**Red 2U**

https://preview.redd.it/do6tz8wtl5y91.png?width=235&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=142e61392d07e0215ff07d973d20dd69d7a0465a

I know, the 2U in the picture is green, not red. But having the 2U being red, or being a shooter candle, increases our probabilities of success. As you can see in the image above, our entry would be the low of the 2U candle and the target is the low of the previous candle.

**Green2Down**

https://preview.redd.it/vwrq3x64m5y91.png?width=232&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02424a571237985e8d732887ba28bd71bf8e8ba1

The bullish reversal is just like the bearish reversal, but inverse. The entry is the high of the 2D candle, and your target would be the high of the previous candle.

And that’s it.

**Some notes:**

&amp;#x200B;

* I always make sure the target if far away from the entry 3%+, less than that it isn’t really worth it. This is called gauging magnitude, make sure to gauge magnitude.
* I never take the trade after it immediately triggers my entry. I always like to wait for confirmation on the 1-hour chart.

# How To Pick Options Contracts

Ok, so now you know how I find my trades. Now let’s discuss how I pick my options contracts, and this will be really short an easy:

&amp;#x200B;

1. I always pick the nearest out of the money strike  
 
2. I don’t enjoy volatility, so I always buy contracts at least 45 days out.  
 
3. That’s it.  
 

# Back test

This strategy might seem too simple (it is), thus some of you may find it too good to be true. I encourage you to go to [TradingView.com](http://tradingview.com/), pick any ticker and find these two setups we talked about.

You will see them on every timeframe, and they work most of the time.

I alert all my trades in real time through my website [Foolproofoptions.com](http://foolproofoptions.com/), and you can find my track record there. Check it out."	0.83	109	0	109	question	2022-11-05T18:51:42Z	ymxsop	t3

Ok apes,

I want excuse me for my English but I'm an Italian APE.

I'm reading so much post that show how the people have no confidence in financial system. Yes we are year since Jan 2021 but we have to believe in our ""weapon"".

We have XXX AMC and (at least) the same number of APE's shares. On 21.11.22 will be the T+90. I'm not saying that we will see an epic run in this date. I trust in Adam Aron and he create APE to have a dilution to help him to pay the debts.

So we have a bomb of three digits potential at 1.5$ at the moment. It's the moment to BUY like 28Jan21 with GME in order to force all short sellers to close their positions. Remember what GME caused to Melvin Capital.

Look at the actual financial situation:

\- CS is in trouble and last week announced to the people to sell their AMC's shares.

\- AMZN, META and other blue chip stocks have bad earnings and hedge funds like Citadel are trying to find money to survive.

I think that there is so much disappointed people that saw their money decrease due to a fraud of Wall Street. I'm here to remind you this message:

I browse this sub a ton and am seeing so many people making x1000 on earnings plays, so I know there's potential. But I also know that bad plays can make you lose everything.

I've been trading for about 6 months, but something happened recently which became the last straw for my gf. Her father is very supportive, and decided to pay for our trip to Greece (he gave us roughly $6k). In the end, we didn't use all of it. My gf insisted we give the rest back to her daddy, and I said it was the right play. However, AMZN was having its earnings and I didn't want to miss out. I thought we could make bank, give the remainder back to her father, and we could have a little extra for ourselves. So I used it all on AMZN calls. Went to 0 real quick.

So now my gf has been mad as hell at me, but why? Her father gave us that money to spend on our trip, he didn't expect to be getting any back. I was trying to do something good for all of us, and I happened to screw up. Now she's refusing to come over. I even drove over to her place with my guitar and tried to serenade her with an apology. She said that until I close my Robinhood account for good, she's done sleeping with me. I don't think that's fair.

wallstreetbets	alphagoescrazy	self.wallstreetbets	8	The most important tip for new traders - BURN YOUR EYES	"It is very important at the beginning of your journey that you be on the screen as much as possible, you need to ""burn your eyes"" on the charts, if it is while the market is open then look at the price movement and if the market is closed then practice on many stocks, mark support and resistance levels, to mark trend lines, see how How have the stocks behaved over the years reaching these levels, how does history repeat itself, are there any repeating signs in the stocks you have looked at, how does the stock compare to the market, screen time is the most important thing for a beginner trader at the beginning.

One of the things I would do at my beginning in trading is I would learn something new, for example, support and resistance levels and I would take all 500 stocks of the S&amp;P 500 and I would mark the levels in all of them, and so I would continue to trend lines, price movement, trend reversals, momentum patterns.

In my opinion, it is super important for a beginner trader and very helpful and it is something I highly recommend"	0.75	4	0	4	question	2022-11-07T11:14:24Z	yoglmw	t3
wallstreetbets	OneClickYouDie	self.wallstreetbets	6	Here is some DD on Senseonics $SENS for all of those who were left homeless and a chance to redeem yourselves.	"$SENS or senseonics is a company that produces diabetes products. Biggest competitor to it are Dexcom and Abbot which are billion dollar companies that have been producing these cgm products for a while.

Senseonics on the other hand just got approved a few months ago. It already landed an approval for the second largest insurance provider in the US.

Here is a bit of today's news https://flashalert.me/?symbol=SENS&amp;source=PR&amp;referer=https://stocktwits.com/&amp;url=https://www.prnewswire.com:443/news-releases/ascensia-diabetes-care-announces-global-integration-of-the-eversense-cgm-system-with-apple-health-301669606.html&amp;s3=SENS/2022-11-07/01-05-14_000000/pr/73947f703419741dbc91b12d10e125b7/ascensia-diabetes-care-announces-global-integration-of-the-eversense-cgm-system-with-apple-health-301669606.html

Not only does senseonics CGM has a 180 days implantable device. It completely obliterates dexcom and Abbotts 14 days. Not to mention they are already thinking even further and are developing the 365 day CGM. 


I sens a buyout coming soon, and it will very likely be from Apple. Apple has been working relentlessly on trying to figure out ways to monitor blood glucose through their apple watches. Not only will this give access to the apple watches to do this but it will put apple inside your body as an implantable device.

You maybe short sides but the potential is huge here. Now add to all of this the news I mentioned above of it being integrated with Apple health. Not to mention senseonics is one of the heavily shorted stocks that happens to be a real growth company. Well you do the math but than again you are on wallstbets so I don't expect you to know math.

\[1\] - The adapter cracked but not melted. Card still works. I put it on the list for overabundance of caution

\[2\] - The quality of the image is low and doesn't seem to be any sign of melting but it seems there's some sign of discoloration. Card still works.

\[3\] - Based on the supplied images, the adapter does not seem to be melting but there's some thinning on the outer edge.

\[4\] - Based on the supplied image, this looks to be more of a physical damage vs thermal melting problem.

\[5\] - Based on the 2 supplied images, there seems to be a chipped damage on one of the pin as well as some sign of discoloration

* Just keeping everyone updated: Out of about 130 emails so far to the 4090cable inbox, we've received 7 that are 150V rated wires (and therefore potentially indicative of different supply), so 5%. That rating doesn't instantly mean it's bad. Replying to a few for info
* And to be really, really clear so people don't panic: Again, we have no evidence presently to suggest 150V cables are instantly bad. All that means is they're the same as what Igor showed - we assume older supply, but not sure. We're trying to get some for testing.
* The spec on the wire really just tells us that the supply is not the correct supply for that wire component. It's supposed to be 300V spec at 105C / 14AWG.
* Also, we're noticing a trend (could be limited sample size, not enough to know) of Zotac cards using this type of cable.
   * **Clarification**: Thanks, should have made it clearer with the vague reference. We don't know what Zotac is using at large. We know that most of the 7 150V ones we've received emails about are Zotac. I think 1-2 are Gigabyte.
* Oh, one other note - of the 130, not that many are actually burned. Still going through everything, but it's below 10 for sure. Several of the ones from reddit are not in our inbox, as they likely already had the cable replaced.

Summary:

* Igor's Labs cable showing 150v spec wire
* All 5x GN adapters show 300v 14AWG 105C on 12v/GND (28 AWG for sense lines)
* GN asked partners and manufacturers and the adapters are supposed to be like the 5 adapters GN has
* GN disagreed with Igor's analysis on the construction quality of the adapter based on the 5 adapters they have
* GN believes Igor's cable is a red herring and ultimately a ""different cable"" than what they own.
* GN noticed different soldering method between their cables and Igor's cable (larger/thicker 2 points on GN vs smaller/thinner 4 points on Igor's)
* GN cables do not snap as easily as Igor's
* \[Editor's Note\] GN is not saying Igor is wrong. GN is saying that Igor has a different adapter than what they own. Igor's conclusion comes from the adapter that he owns.
* **GN needs your help!!!**

   * **How to: Start with** [**Timestamp here**](https://youtu.be/EIKjZ1djp8c?t=720)
* Test Scenarios
   * GN tested 3 cards
   * Tested with 4 different cables
      * Stock
      * Uncut cable, bad contact
      * Both sides cut and bad contact
      * 1 side cut other side w/ bad contact
   * Plus Overclocked on each scenarios
* Most intense scenario is 8 hours full load with damaged cable
   * No damage even with this most intense scenario
* tldr conclusion:
   * There are enough failures to say that this is an issue. However, not every adapter has this issue.
   * GN needs your help!! Please watch the video starting at Timestamp above

**October 27, 2022 - The horror has a face – NVIDIA’s hot 12VHPWR adapter for the GeForce RTX 4090 with a built-in breaking point -** [**https://www.igorslab.de/en/adapter-of-the-gray-analyzed-nvidias-brand-hot-12vhpwr-adapter-with-built-in-breakpoint/**](https://www.igorslab.de/en/adapter-of-the-gray-analyzed-nvidias-brand-hot-12vhpwr-adapter-with-built-in-breakpoint/)

* The problem is not the 12VHPWR connection as such, nor the repeated plugging or unplugging.
* Standard compliant power supply cables from brand manufacturers are NOT affected by this so far.
* The current trigger is NVIDIA’s own adapter to 4x 8-pin in the accessories, whose inferior quality can lead to failures and has already caused damage in single cases.
* Splitting each of the four 14AWG leads onto each of the 6 pins in the 12VHPWR connector of the adapter by soldering them onto bridges that are much too thin is dangerous because the ends of the leads can break off at the solder joint (e.g., when kinked or bent several times).
* Bending or kinking the wires directly at the connector of the adapter puts too much pressure on the solder joints and bridges, so that they can break off.
* The inner bridge between the pins is too thin (resulting cross section) to compensate the current flow on two or three instead of four connected 12V lines.
* NVIDIA has already been informed in advance and the data and pictures were also provided by be quiet! directly to the R&amp;amp;D department.

I'm typing up a short DD to explain a position I plan on entering Monday morning.

&amp;#x200B;

Since Nov 1, executive board members at $MRK have sold over $180 million dollars worth of stock, including the most recent sale (**$59,911,004)** by Kenneth Frazier, executive chairman and former CEO of the pharmaceutical company Merck &amp; Co.

Every  FTSE 100 bear rally has ended at almost YTD, that's some real strength tho...

Its defensive composition and high dividend yield definitely helped,  DXY also boosted a good part of its revenues.

UK macro does not look good at all:

CPI 10.1/  forecast 10.4 (16/11)

CPI MoM 0.5 / forecast 1.5

Core CPI (uptrend) 6.5

PPI  downtrend but still at 15.9 = bullish for CPI

M2 still in uptrend

Record rate hikes by BoE are doing nothing and GILTS yields already gave problems 28/09...

[chart 1\) UK 10y yield](https://preview.redd.it/ubje25yuvfy91.png?width=1791&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58bca5c8b689c0ad99a3bebdff156510d0d781ca)

28/09 (yellow vertical line) - BoE bought GILTS and they saved UK pension funds. 10y yield topped at 4.5%

BoE started the real QT just a few days ago, it's gonna be bullish for yields...

rate hikes won't stop + QT are going to push the 10y yield way higher: the last 2 bullruns have been +290% &amp; 150%, just saying

guess what's going to happen again at +4.5%, definitely not bullish for FTSE 100

[chart 2\) FTSE 100](https://preview.redd.it/bsofa60xvfy91.png?width=1791&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7d8e0f2df590a27a416ff2d65e123d248e37c72)

As I said, UK main index showed some crazy strength during the entire year, compared to the S&amp;P 500

Every bear rally has ended at almost YTD and RSI 1d range 60-70

all bear rallies topped almost togheter in FTSE 100 and SPX charts (yellow lines)

Now, **the last rally has not corrected yet (chart 2):** FTSE had the best week of the year (+4.07%) and **now it's at -3.70% YTD**

The last bullrun broke a key resistance at 7170, that's also a monthly POC line (I didn't show that)

is that bullish at all? I don't think so, that index broke resistance and 50/100/200 moving averages like nothing the entire year (that's why MA don't work in a flat scenario)

I think it's gonna get rejected  by 7360 resistance

[stock map](https://preview.redd.it/ckc61n33wfy91.jpg?width=1915&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be044aeb6c64cdcce2e6140e073c53e234a3365d)

last day 4/11 was the 6th green day of the year (+2.03%), but as the stockmap shows, miners (non energy minerals)  and banks pumped the index

Miners skyrocketed  probably because GOLD had the best day of the year and...

CNBC:

&gt;The Bank of England said Thursday that the U.K. is facing its longest recession since records began  
&gt;  
&gt;The central bank described the outlook for Britain’s economy as “very  challenging,” noting that unemployment would likely double during the  country’s two-year slump

real recession scenario = big money moves into defensive assets, like miners and gold

everything else has been pumped the last weeks to give the best exit price for big money, IMO miners alone won't hold the entire index up... I expect a correction and new FTSE100 lows in the medium term, I might be wrong but at least a small correction is indeed:

RSI 1h, 4h and 1d topped. Market indexes do not move in a straight line

also, europoor indexes with similar technicals:

wallstreetbets	its_me_cindy	self.wallstreetbets	57	Apple warns Covid restrictions in China are hurting iPhone production	"*China needs to seriously chill*

Apple said in a statement on Sunday that it has temporarily reduced iPhone 14 production because of Covid-19 restrictions at its primary iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max assembly plant in Zhengzhou, China.

The factory, operated by Foxconn, is operating at “significantly reduced capacity,” Apple said. It warned that it would ship fewer units and that customers would experience longer wait times when ordering devices.

Apple’s warning brings up the possibility that it may sell fewer iPhones in the December quarter because it is having trouble making enough to meet demand. It previously signaled slowing growth in the December quarter last month.

It said that it continues to see strong demand for the affected models, which are higher-priced than other iPhone models and start at $999 and $1099.

In the past week, China has ordered lockdowns in Zhengzhou, where Apple does the majority of its iPhone production. The factory in China has grappled with employees fleeing the facility because of its Covid policies and outbreaks, according to Reuters.

China continues to pursue a “zero-Covid” policy that requires facilities like the iPhone facility in Zhengzhou to operate as “closed loops,” where workers isolate in dorms and work in factories separated from the outside world.

It currently takes 31 days to receive an iPhone 14 Pro if ordered from Apple’s website, longer than the average 2-day lead time for less-expensive iPhone models, JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee said in a note on Sunday.

"Intro: The Trade Desk (TTD) is an American multinational technology company that specializes in real-time programmatic marketing automation technologies, products, and services, designed to personalize digital content delivery to users. All this jargon essentially means it is a 3rd party platform that allows for ads to be personalized. This sounds all awesome until you realize some key features of the stock.

1). Massive competition 

As stated before TTD is a digital ad provider. They use a lot of jargon to make themselves seem more innovative than they are but at the end of the day they are a little fish in a big pond. Their biggest competition comes from ad dynamos like Meta and Google. They also have to compete with a large number of others like Amazon and Microsoft who are smaller players but still massive compared to The Trade Desk.


2). The premium is too high

They have a P/E ratio of 680 and if they can’t produce a profit this quarter, the P/E will only get higher if they can’t produce a significant profit during these earnings. If this is coupled with the fact that revenue growth is slumping and profit is drying up, the stock will drop immensely because people will consider it overvalued.

3). Unfriendly economic conditions for ads

We are in a recession and when in a recession advertisers spend less on ads. The reason being that they will get significantly smaller returns because less people will have disposable income to spend on unnecessary products. This is very bad for TTD due to the fact their business relies on advertisers and if they get scared they're revenue and profit will grow significantly less. But all of this combined with the next point is what will cause the catastrophic drop that is about to occur.
 
4). The guidance nail in the coffin

Guidance is what this market lives off of now. We've seen it a million times, especially with PAYPAL and others where companies can have  decent earnings but terrible guidance and drop accordingly. TTD will have bad guidance so to the fact that in a recession nothing is guaranteed, especially not for advertising and they can't have good guidance because of the economic conditions.

5). Bull thesis

This is the devil's advocate that I personally don't believe but it is important to include so people see the whole picture. Last earnings, TTD shot way up on great revenue growth. I don't think this will occur due to the reasons stated above but it is a possibility and important to keep in mind 

7) TL;DR

$TTD(The Trade Desk), is an overvalued digital ad provider who will flop on earnings due to slowing revenue growth, shrinking profit and poor guidance.

8). Position.

I have 44.5 puts expiring next week but I'm going in on more tomorrow and probably at a lower strike. I know it's not a lot but I'm 18 and my family is poor as shit so I'm going all in with an extra 7K on Monday. Yolo, food stamps or Ferraris lol.

***Brace Yourself -Winter Is Coming*** \- Ned Star. 298 AC

[If we could put a visual on a severe recession or market collapse...](https://preview.redd.it/kdqokhgcwey91.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae8b8c29cae8340da6261822acd9ea2a147dd77c)

&amp;#x200B;

*BAYER AG  is as cheap as it has ever been.*

**The FEAR :**

1. **EUROPE IS GOING TO SH\*T**
2. **THE LITIGATIONS**

FINANCIALS are at the bottom; just know that it has a ZACK score of 2 (buy) For now, just know Bayer's cash on hand for the quarter ending March 31, 2022, was $9.195B and that one year's revenue is more than its entire market cap with meaningless debt.

**COUNTDOWN TO LAUNCH...**

# 5) MORE...I WANT MORE:  increase revenue with looming European recession 

Essential needs and mega-trends in crop science foreseeable future. Being the largest seed and crop science company in existence since your president was a cowboy.

If you think Bayer AG will be badly impacted by the rise of energy cost think again; Bayer is not extremely energy intensive. Energy costs are making up only about 3% of costs of goods sold  

***Increase revenue guidance and outlook for 2022 alone:***

* **Crop Science:**  100% growth in seed and protection market for 2022 alone. (5% to 10%)
* **Pharamaceuticals:** Expands from 5% to 6%
* **Consumer health:** Expands from 4% from 5%

# 4) $200B WHO CARES ABOUT THE E.U THE GERMAN RISE! 

Germans $200B stimulus - Spend their way to avoid recession (25% if this will be for corporation. Bayer stands to benefit even more) the EU is so fearful of this German aggressive spending, they sound the alarm hoping no other European nations follow suit, that would only make inflation worst and kick the can down the road.. yet Bayer just making more. The evidence is in the increased revenue guidance.

&amp;#x200B;

# 3) WIN! OR SETTLE!  75%CLOSED IN 4 YEARS, 25%LEFT = If 75% in 4 years, then the remaining 25% in...

Remember **they have already set the cash aside,** **and have won or litigated the majority of all cases.** The rest are likely to head on the same path. 

Bayer is still facing litigations due to the acquisition of Monsanto and RoundUp and during the last earnings call, Werner Baumann gave updated numbers. There are about 141,000 claims in total and about 108,000 have been settled.

 For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic. This includes recent conclusions by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the EU’s Assessment Group on Glyphosate (AGG), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), and the leading health authorities in Germany, Australia, Korea, Canada, New Zealand, and Japan.

**China's strong trade relations with German**y are set to be further strengthened with major multinational companies' remarkable presence at the China International Import Expo.  Bayer is among the first batch of companies to present at the newly-established crop seed industry subsection at this year's CIIE.

But my brain cell tells me that the market will not dip this year due to tax loss selling. After all, tax loss selling is done to offset capital gains.  Bulls don't have capital gains this year...only losses.  And they have either sold already or are HODLing. I feel it's unlikely the HODLers remaining this far into the bear market will sell now.

The only market players with capital gains this year are the bears, who in theory would offset those gains by closing out unprofitable shorts... leading to a possible head fake rally.

What do you think?

* Canopy Growth has a good plan to enter the United States
* Constellation Brands partnership will protect it from bankruptcy
* This stock will give 1000%+ returns upon federal legalization in the United States

Currently in the United States THC is federally banned, meaning banks cannot loan to any marijuana companies without risking federal penalties. Currently in the Senate a bill has been proposed to allow banks to give loans to ""legitimate marijuana companies"".

This bill is the SAFE Banking Act of 2021 and has the following party supporters:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/058eb004vey91.jpg?width=1202&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ae791118c6784cd83d301f9f316b195ed0bfd63

SAFE Banking Act of 2021

Canopy Growth is a high risk stock. Marijuana almost entirely depends on THC becoming legalized federally in the United States. But I believe that Canopy Growth is undervalued because of its unique partnerships with Constellation Brands, the people who make Corona Beer.

Constellation Brands currently holds 21.76% of Canopy Growth (CBG Holdings LLC) and has reaffirmed their partnership as recently as August 2022. Fore those details see blow:

[https://www.cbrands.com/news/articles/constellation-brands-announces-plan-to-convert-common-stock-holding-in-canopy-growth-1](https://www.cbrands.com/news/articles/constellation-brands-announces-plan-to-convert-common-stock-holding-in-canopy-growth-1)

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bxhjoc70vey91.jpg?width=1092&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3eefb363bf5ef93fda8f49484847eef6d4a0b110

Canopy Growth Holdings

This partnership is fantastic, as the actual fundamentals for Canopy Growth are not good. The company as it stands has negative cashflow of 539 million dollars a year, but is projected to lower that loss to 361. They do have a cash pile of 1.217 billion and total debt of 1.457 billion. So their survival is absolutely not guaranteed, but better than competitors because of the multi-billion revenue partner with Constellation Brands.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/m6mx7o25vey91.jpg?width=678&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a30ea71ea066fd6de395ee1b89caec679a2bd8c1

Canopy Growth Balance Sheet

Additionally Canopy Growth thickens the deal on federal legalization by having the rights to own the largest THC manufacturer in the United States, Wana Brands. On the condition that the deal will close ONLY when THC is legalized federally. Currently Wana Brands makes about 23.2 million dollars of revenue annually, but will serve as the company's launch pad into the United States with federal legalization. Constellation Brands will then step in and dump tons of cash into the company to begin production of beer infused with THC during the same period. Canopy Growth will likely see itself jump up to a multi-billion dollar revenue company overnight.

Canopy Growth will survive through any recession during 2023 and will likely live to see the day of bipartisan support for federal marijuana legalization, with pre-cursors such as banking becoming legal/more decriminalization first. By the end of this decade, THC will be federally legal in the United States as it currently has bipartisan support and popular support with voters."	0.79	19	0	19	dd	2022-11-07T01:58:48Z	yo5lw8	t3

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%. (Stats as of 2022-10-28)"	0.74	9	0	9	dd	2022-11-07T01:26:24Z	yo4v4p	t3

Meanwhile, primary data are information that has to be collected by direct means such as interviews, measurements or polls. In this paper, only secondary data and data derived from it are used. Following the main data related to the company that are mainly used for the evaluation models:

# Evaluation Methods

In this post, **three evaluation methods are used** to evaluate the company's final fair value. Each method gives us different current fair values for a single share of the company. The final price tag is determined by the average price between all the methods used.

&amp;#x200B;

Note: all numbers are in thousands

## Growth Rate

**The Growth Rate of -5.70%** is calculated taking in count the previous year earnings and its historical ROE calculated by the average ROE from 2019 to 2022 of -5.70%.

## Free Cash Flow Evaluation Model

This simple model takes in mind the company 2022 reported Free Cash Flow and its WACC based discounted rate of 9.62% and its Growth Rate of \[*scenatio 1; scenario 2; scenario 3*\]% to determine a fair value of:

1. $0.10
2. $0.37
3. $0.77

Note: the Scenario 2 and 3 is computed by using the assumption that the company will have positive free cash flow by end of 2023 as the managment planned, we assume a FCF of 10 milion

## Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula

This model is used in the Value Investing communities to price tag a company based on its intrinsic value. This formula is created by Benjamin Graham, a value investor and professor at Columbia University who is considered the father of Value Investing.

**Intrinsic value = EPS × \[(8.5 + (2 × Expected annual growth rate, g)\]**

Which 8.5 is the P/E base of a no-growth company, and the expected growth rate is the company perpetual growth rate for the future.

In 1974, in the revised edition of **The Intelligent Investor**, Graham revised the formula to

**Intrinsic value = \[EPS × (8.5 + 2\*g) × 4.4\]/Y**

In this formula, 4.4 is the then prevailing (1962) rate on high-grade corporate bonds listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Y is the current yield on AAA-rated corporate bonds.

Graham thought that as the investor had the choice between putting money in common stocks or bonds, it was appropriate to take into account the rate of interest paid on a high-grade bond of 4.4 per cent in determining the intrinsic value of a stock.

In this thesis we use an adjusted formula

**Intrinsic value = \[EPS × (7 + 1\*g) × 4.4\]/Y**

The P/E of 7 is used because even if a company has zero growth prospects, but it is able to maintain cash flows and distribute dividends, its P/E is generally higher than 8.5.

The used growth rate is the one calculated in the three scenarios.

The '2' multiplier is too aggressive. Graham never experienced companies with growth rates of 15-25 per cent, which is common today. Instead of '2', here it is used 1 instead.

The interest rate of 4.4 is left as the original, some modern adjustment put this value at 8.5, which is the five-year fixed deposit rate. This value is the substitute of the risk-free rate, which sometimes can be used instead of 4.4.

Data used for the calculation:

|EPS|4.66|
|:-|:-|
|Growth Rate|\[Scenario 1; Scenario 2; Scenario 3\]|
|AAA Bond Yield|5.17|

The Adjusted Graham Intrinsic Value Formula gives us a price tag of

1. $0.45
2. $4.19
3. $6.63

&amp;#x200B;

## Discounted Unlevered Free Cash Flow Model

A modified version of the traditional Discounted Cash Flow. This model instead of using the free cash flow, uses the unlevered one.

Unlevered free cash flow (UFCF, also known as Free cash Flow to the Firm) is **the amount of available cash a firm has before accounting for its financial obligations**. Free cash flow (FCF), on the other hand, is the money a company has left over after paying its operating expenses and capital expenditures. It is used to remove the impact of capital structure on a firm's value and to make companies more comparable

In simple words. It is the cash flow of a company based on the belief that the company owes no debt, therefore has no interest payments to make.

In this model, it is taken in mind the following data:

|WACC based discount rate|6.45%|
|:-|:-|
|Growth rate|\[Scenario 1; Scenario 2; Scenario 3\]|
|Average US GDP growth rate|3.18%|
|rage Shares outstanding|611,402,300|

This model gives us a price tag of:

1. \-$3.22
2. $1.12
3. $4.97

## Final Fair Value

The Final price tag is determined as per following:

||Fair Value|
|:-|:-|
|**Scenario 1**|\-$0.89|
|**Scenario 2**|$1.89|
|**Scenario 3**|$4.12|
|**Average of the three scenarios**|**$1.70**|

* **Tilray Inc has a well-established IT system** that ensures efficiency in its internal and external operations.
* **Tilray Inc owns a number of intellectual property rights** that include trademarks and patents. These allow it exclusivity over its products and competitors cannot copy or reverse engineer them.
* **Tilray Inc is a brand that has been in the market for years**, and people are aware of it. This makes its brand awareness high.
* **Its products have maintained quality over the years** and are still valued by customers, who find it as good value for the amount of money that they pay.
* **Partnership**s: Strategic partnerships are established by Tilray Inc with its suppliers, dealers, retailers and other stakeholders. This allows it to leverage them if need be in the future.

## Weaknesses

* **Research and Development**: Even though Tilray Inc is spending more than the average research and development expenditure within the industry, it is spending way less than a few players within the industry that have had a significant advantage as a result of their innovative products.
* **High Day Sales Inventory**: The time it takes for products to be purchased and sold are higher than the industry average, meaning that Tilray Inc builds up on inventory adding unnecessary costs to the business.
* **Rented Property**: A significant proportion of the property that Tilray Inc owns is rented rather than purchased. It has to pay large amounts of rent on these adding to its costs.
* **Low current ratio**: The current ratio that shows the company’s ability to meet its short term financial obligations, is lower than the industry average. This could mean that the company could have liquidity problems in the future.
* **The company has low levels of current assets compared to current liabilities**, and this can create liquidity problems for it in operations.
* **Cash flow problems**: There is a lack of proper financial planning at Tilray Inc regarding cash flows, leading to certain circumstances where there isn’t enough cash flow as required leading to unnecessary unplanned borrowing.
* **Integration**: Tilray Inc's current structure and culture have resulted in the failure of various mergers aimed at vertical integration.
* **Market Research**: Tilray Inc has not conducted market research within the market that is serves since the past 2 years. As a result, it is making decisions based on years old data, while customer needs may have evolved over time.
* **High employee turnover rates**: Tilray Inc has a higher employee turnover rate compared to competitors. This means that it has more people leaving the job, and as a result, it is spending more on training and development as employees keep leaving and joining.
* **Quality Control**: Tilray Inc has a lower budget for its quality control department than competitors. This leads to lack of consistency and the possibility of damage to quality across its various outlets.
* **Lack of legal experience** and legal department employees are not highly qualified.
* **A few products have a high market share**, while most of the products have a low market share. This reliance on a few products makes Tilray Inc vulnerable to external threats if these few products suffer for any reason.
* **The workload is a high per worker** as there are fewer workers than the actual work required. This puts workers under psychological stress and is likely to be less productive.
* **Worker morale is low due to company culture** and politics that have grown in recent years.
* **Competition and qualified employees have been leaving** the organisation in recent years, which could mean a shortage of good talent for the company in the upcoming years.
* **The decision making is highly centralized**, and decisions by teams need to be approved by certain officials. This reduces efficiency in operations by making them more time consuming. It also leads to reduced innovation.
* **The performance appraisal is not in a systematic manner**. People are often not appraised for their performance. This leads to lower work morale and lack of promotion opportunities for employees.

## Opportunities

* **Internet**: there has been an increase in the number of internet users all over the world. This means that there is an opportunity for Tilray Inc to expand their presence online; by using the internet to interact with its customers.
* **E-commerce**: There has been a new trend and a growth in sales of the e-commerce industry. This means that a lot of people are now making purchases online. Tilray Inc can earn revenue by opening online stores and making sales through these.

The three social media platforms; Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, have shown the greatest number of increase in monthly active users. Tilray Inc can use social media to promote its products, interact with customers and collect feedback from them.
* **Technological developments**: technology comes with numerous benefits among many departments. Operations can be automated to reduce costs. Technology enables better data to be collected on customers and improves on marketing efforts.
* **Population**: the population has been growing and is expected to grow at a positive rate for the upcoming years. This is beneficial for Tilray Inc as there will be an increase in the number of potential customers that it can target.
* **Green government drive**: this provides an opportunity for Tilray Inc for the sale of Tilray Inc's products to federal and state government contractors.
* **Transport Industry**: the transport industry has been flourishing in the past few years, and shows growth potential in the future. This has reduced the costs of transportation, which is beneficial for Tilray Inc as it will lower its overall costs.
* **Tax policy:** the governments’ reduction in tax rate is beneficial for Tilray Inc as a lower amount would be expensed out as a tax.
* **Tourism:** growth in tourism is beneficial for Tilray Inc as it will provide new potential customers that it can target in order to gain market share.
* **Skilled workers:** increase in education and training by numerous institutes has increased the amount of skilled labor available within the country. This means that if Tilray Inc is able to hire skilled labor, it would have to spend less on training and development, therefore, saving costs.
* **A number of new niche markets have opened up that are growing**. Tilray Inc can sell products in these markets and take advantage.

* **Suppliers:** The bargaining power of suppliers has increased over the years with the decrease in the number of suppliers. This means that the costs of inputs could increase for Tilray Inc.
* **New entrants:** there have been numerous players that have entered the market and are gaining market share by gaining existing companies’ market share. This is a threat to Tilray Inc as it can lose its customers to these new entrants.
* **Increasing competition**: there has been an increase in competition within the industry putting downward pressure on prices. This could lead to reduced revenue for Tilray Inc if it adjusts to the price changes, or loss of market share if it doesn’t.
* **Exchange Rate:** the exchange rate keeps fluctuating and this affects a company like Tilray Inc that has sales internationally, while its suppliers are local.
* **Political uncertainties** in the country prove to be a barrier in business, hindering performance at times and making the business incur unnecessary costs.
* **The fluctuating interest rates** in the country do not provide a stable financial and economic environment.
* **Consumer tastes are changing**, and this puts pressure on companies to constantly change their products to meet the needs of these customers.
* **Substitute products available are also increasing**, which is threat collectively for the whole industry as consumption of current products decrease.
* **The rise in prices of fuel** has increased in the input costs for Tilray Inc. These costs have also increased as other industries that provide inputs for this company also have suffered from increasing fuel prices, thereby charging more.
* **Increased promotions by competitors** have been a threat for Tilray Inc. On most media, there is more clutter than ever, and customers are bombarded with multiple messages. This reduces the effectiveness of promotional messages by Tilray Inc.
* **Constant technological developments require the workforce to be trained** accordingly as the inability to keep up with these changes can lead to loss of business for Tilray Inc.

# Final Considerations

**What is its future potential?**

Without Legalization, the company is destined to fail. It is burning its cash at a 2.09 rate, leaving it only 25 months of life expectancy (take in mind that this is an assumption cause obviously in those 25 months the company will have sales and other operations bringing in cash, the life expectancy is calculated on the assumption the company will not have further sales or other income of cash, so take this data as indicative).  If we assume a recover of macro data, consumption shall growth in other segments in which the company operates, cause marijuana is not its biggest nor main revenue stream. The company is well diversified of even without legalisation we shall expect to see it aroun in the next 5 years.

With Legalizaion, it is moon time baby. Its fundamentals, at the most conservative assumptions, prices it around 4$ but we all know that hype will push it further that price level bring it to be overvalued. Retailers and institution will surely try to cash in the hype so beware of speculative plays.

With the legalization scenarios, we can expect two outcomes:

1. The Management do not manage to contain costs and improve efficiency, making it growth slow
2. The Management manages to cut cost and boost efficiency, making Tilray grow

There is potential, but risk is very high

**What are the risks?**

Observing statistical data about Tilray's price movements, we can except a 7.72% risk rate. The Stock's return distribution is concentrated around negative numbers. If you want to invest for long time expect a miminum retuern rate of 0.12% and a 44% chancge of getting a daily price movement between -4% and 0%

**Is the company a Buy or a Sell?**

This is hard. It all depend on legalization in the USA, and if it happens, it depends on when it happens. If legalization comes in 5 years, welp, this company is going tits up, but if it come next week, well, you know the drill.

Personally this stock is a Gamble, cause its fate is determined heavily by politics.

Are you a Gamblerer?

What is this new equity investment? If it normal to always be at 0? Is  it legal that Freetrade added me to this new investment without my consent?

The old users are slowly crumbling away and the new ones want Tik Tok or Reels. It said somewhere that reels don't bring in nearly as much cash per second of screen time as classic posts. There may be other factors involved. In any case, they see that it can't go any further and there is no other option for growth in sight, so they  go All In in to the Metaverse. It is questionable if the Metaverse by Meta will have prevailed in 5 - 10 years in view of so many other hardware and software solutions. Yesterday I was at an event sponsored by HTC VR and there, among others, Autodesk (professional software giant) presented their new collaboration with Epic Games (Unreal Engine, Fortnite). Absolutely mega impressive (especially if you compare the Meta Connect Key Note with it the other day). But they approach the ""M"" (metaverse) subject as they call it, with great understatement.

It’s currently at $40.58, I expect RBLX to hit $33.20 within the next 2 weeks.

I’ll explain my thesis, but before I explain… I know some of you will be talking sh\*t in the comments.

And I understand. I’d do the same thing if I didn't know any better…

**So, here are a few of my recent plays:**

**$DKNG:** Went long on OCT 25 at $13.91, sold NOV 1 for $16.34 for **17.47% profit in 7 days.**

**$CCJ:** Went short on OCT 10 at $26.23, closed the next day at $22.43. **14.49% profit in 1 day.**

**$UAL:** Went long on OCT 17 at $36.53, closed Oct 17 for $40.12. **9.83% profit in 2 days.**

**$GM:** Went long on Oct 17 at $33.42, still holding and up **17.71% after 19 days.**

If you want to see more evidence of my past trades, you can see my trade log which is in the link in my profile, or you can PM me, and I’ll send it to you.

Now that we got that out of the way, let’s talk about $RBLX:

My thesis is that $RBLX just SUCKS tbh.

Literally it SUCKS. It has to go down.

Nah, I’m kidding.

Here’s $RBLX 2 week chart.

https://preview.redd.it/mgmdm0d7ldy91.png?width=1443&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25c09341d415df62e3aec41da65459d30f8ca633

As you can see, the candle showing the last week is a shooter.

80% of the time this means that it’s going back down to the previous candle’s low.

That’s my thesis. And before any of you come at me with some BS - my track record speaks for itself.

**Earnings:**

If companies like Meta, Microsoft, and Google all missed. What makes you think RBLX won't?

I could be wrong though, and the fact that this is an earnings play means I’m going in with small size.

**Entry:**

Don’t be dumb and enter the trade on Monday when the market opens.

RBLX has a support level on $39.55. If RBLX does not break that support level, you should **NOT ENTER** the trade until that support level is broken.

https://preview.redd.it/86dg53c9ldy91.png?width=1443&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=112bf951efaca3d2891abd55e02b8bbb3f8ec3c6

I like to look at the hourly chart.

If RBLX breaks that support level and confirms on the hourly chart, I’m going in.

“Confirms” means that you wait for an hourly candle to close below the support level.

**Warning**\*

Earnings play, go with small size.

You can private message me, and I’ll let you know when/if I enter the trade."	0.84	17	0	17	chart	2022-11-06T21:41:20Z	ynymmh	t3

The Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO) provides the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) near-term perspective on energy markets. Each month, the STEO provides forecasts through the end of the next calendar year for consumption, supply, trade, and prices across major fuel types. In addition, the STEO provides in-depth market analysis for crude oil, petroleum products, and natural gas markets. Although its emphasis is on U.S. energy markets, the STEO also includes forecasts for certain international liquid fuels markets.

Here's a snippet of the last STO report giving us guidance on gasoline prices. Yes they did know about OPEC + production cuts by the time this report came out.

This is important because the 10 year notes are most closely associated with mortgages and consumer loans and economic sentiment. Higher yields generally mean less demand for these bonds.

To get a look at how these rates have been moving, here's a picture for you.

Initial Jobless Claims measures the number of individuals who filed for unemployment insurance for the first time during the past week. This is the earliest U.S. economic data, but the market impact varies from week to week.

So as long as this number stays low, you can argue the job market is still strong. The picture shows the trend based on the last few months, and it's really been going down from June to August numbers

Friday Nov 11th, Consumer Sentiment Report

Consumer sentiment is exactly what it say it is. It's a measure of consumer sentiment done by the University of Michigan and they essentially create an index number that is measuring against a base year. In 1966 of Q1, the index number was established at 100. As these index numbers decline, it means consumer sentiment is falling.

So why is this important? Well what is the key component in GDP? GDP is made up of four segments: Consumer Spending, Business investment, Government spending, Net exports

Here's a picture showing how much consumer spending makes up in relation to GDP

[GDP Q3 2022 Unchained](https://i.postimg.cc/fWXDRcLb/image.png)

If you look at the right side at the unchained dollars (adjusted for inflation) 20.021 trillion in GDP and of that amount, 14.149 trillion was consumer spending. So yes, consumer sentiment is important.

wallstreetbets	DaddyDersch	self.wallstreetbets	16	"Trading ""Level to Level"" with Options"	"**How to Trade Level to Level**

This is a question I must get at least 10 times a day. So I am going to indepth do my best to explain to you guys what a Level to Level or L2L play is for me. 

The whole reason I started including more of these is that despite this being a scalpers market I realize its nearly impossible for someone to mirror a scalp. While it can be done the reward generally will never be as great as mine for the mirror. These plays are more of a set it and forget it sort of play and a play that due to the longer DTE and longer time held everyone can play them while still having a great risk to reward play. 

**Picking a DTE**

First off this is NOT a scalp this is a play that will usually take a while to develop and very well could develop overnight too. With that in mind that immediately means we need a slightly longer DTE to utilize. For SPY I prefer a 3-5dte, however, this also greatly varies on the actual way premiums and theta are hitting. When I play a Tesla or Apple L2L I prefer at least 3dte or longer. Since general stocks only expire on Fridays that means pretty much after Tuesday I will refer to the next weeks DTE. The issue especially with a stock like Tesla is that it moves like Wildfire so if you are wrong or the play does move against you then you will need to your way you will get wrecked before its ever worth it. 

You have to weigh a short enough DTE that the move nets you profits quickly but not so short that if the play takes time to develop as it usually does that you don’t end up missing out hugely. 

**Choosing the correct position size** 

This is the one tricky thing about the L2L plays. We have to chose a size big enough that the risk to reward is there and that we get a nice pay out. However, we can not immediately open such a large position size that we end up with a big loss if it goes against us. 

The way I enter my position sizes is of a normal scalp size (which is about $2000-$2500 for me). I like to open at least 50-75% immediately depending on how strongly I feel about the play. If I feel its going to be a pretty aggressive move and that im timing pretty much right before the bounce then I will open closer to 75% if not more and end up near $2000 for the trade. However, if like Friday I expect it to consolidate first possibly then I will usually start with about $1000-$1500 initially opened. This allows me to average down if I feel the play is valid and it holds my stop loss. 

But wait! DD you say averaging down a loser is just making a loser a bigger loser!? Correct! I did say that… however, that applies mostly for a scalp. I NEVER add to my scalps because those are 0dte… And those are pretty much hit or miss. I either immediately hit profits and close or im pretty much immediately wrong too. So averaging that down is not smart. However, this play factors in an average down on purpose and also uses clear support/ resistance levels to average down. 

**When to stop loss out**

The thing about these level to level plays that I enjoy is that they have a built in stop. So let me post an example of that from Friday. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gyxlirrs5dy91.png?width=794&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c334066f4339df0ea6f1b3621210da0c8aed6c2a

So here you can see I already KNEW that my stop loss was going to be if a candle closes below 370.6. Now you gotta be forgiving with this too. So within reason because we did have a candle close near 370.5. So if we had closed under 370 I would have closed this play. The important thing I factor into this also is that I want my stop loss to be somewhere around 20% still. That’s just how my risk to reward and win rate works. I don’t want one L2L loss to wipe out numerous L2L wins. 

**When to average down?** 

Lets take a look at a Tesla L2L I took on Friday also and this will be a great example of a time where averaging down works. Friday when tesla on the daily had appeared to be holding 210 support and forming a nice double bottom I entered a 7dte ATM Call. My take profit target was near 215 to 219.3. Looking back at the daily and weekly charts I know that Tesla for the last 2 weeks has broken through 205.6 support numerous times but everytime it has popped back up and refused to close below it. So what I did was purposefully make my stop loss closing UNDER 205.6 EOD. This gave me enough room where at the LOD I still only saw about -30% 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ke1qvu9t5dy91.png?width=677&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2afd0346939b4b734eba1c269086788d3729de0

Okay above you can see my call out on the play. Now lets look at how it actually played out intraday. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ud60poqt5dy91.png?width=825&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=37d77f12eb18e0ec03fda6482dfa1f8baa974a58

So with this Tesla L2L you REALLY had to trust the levels. You had to trust that even though we broke key support that we were going to see a recovery by EOD which has historically happened time and time again. This was a great Risk to reward play as this is probably one of the strongest levels tesla has. 

Now looking back I could have absolutely waited for 205.6 support test before initially entering the play, but on Friday you can see we had that massive sell off after a strong morning and we had bounced off that key 210 support are intraday and was appearing to recover. The one thing looking back that I DID misplay on this was not waiting for the candle to break back over the 5ema before entering this play. However, leaving room to average down and knowing the key levels we can be a little aggressive and sometimes snag a more reward in doing so if we recognize the risk. 

So here once EOD we broke back over that 205.6 level and closed back over the 5ema I was able to average down on my call. I did end up hitting exactly break even at one point EOD before the choppiness hit. With this support level being so strong I felt comfortable swinging this over the weekend. Knowing that we could retest 205.6 but most likely would bounce but after that EOD recovery I expect to see a bigger push up at open Monday to look for an exit. 

**How I choose the play**

The way I choose my level to level plays is based off daily price action along with current intraday price action. What I am looking for is when we find a key support area on the daily chart that the intraday 15min chart is then finding support at. 

Lets take a look at another example from Friday 11/4/22 on SPY. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0l8hhl9u5dy91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=989b59106a6c151a892065b2d55b64a1066306cd

Taking a look at Friday here is a L2L play that I made on Friday. So you can see I clearly have highlighted in purpose 370.6 as a key support. This is one of my levels established from my TA on the SPY daily chart. What I saw here is that after the massive morning sell off we bounced hard off 370.6 and continued to hold all candles closing over this level. We had about 10 candles bounce off this level total. When I saw this extremely strong support establishing around this level I knew it was time to enter a LEVEL TO LEVEL play. 

The first thing and most important thing is we have to chose a DTE. For me I chose a 5DTE. Why did I choose a 5DTE? When we first bounced and double bottomed off the 370.6 level at noon I Did expect a big bounce back up near that 374.9 resistance, however, I knew it could consolidate there first (which is exactly what ended up happening). Had I taken a 0dte play here by time EOD that move up finally happened I would have been. 

Now that I chose the correct DTE we have to set our TP target and our Stop loss target. 

Take profit will for a call play be the next resistance which in this case is 374.9. 

Stop loss target as I mentioned was a FULL candle closed below 370.6. As breaking that key support would signal a bigger downside to come on SPY. On the daily 370.6 is actually a huge level support that separates periods of price action. 

Once we enter the play do we diamond hand it or do we take profits when we can? Well this is where things get tricky. In the end PROFITS are KING.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4f2i8xru5dy91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c11ab6d8601a1e50a9822ba71a35e2b76169eb16

Here is what it looks like for me at least on a few different L2L plays from earlier Friday morning. As you can see for these I actually entered a 3dte and 5dte on SPY (I actually usually do this to show you guys the difference in pay out not so much because I wanna play it both ways) but for tesla I did enter the 0dte because in the morning that’s how strongly I felt about the play and knew it would hit quick but would let the 7dte tesla play out longer.

Usually I look for at least 10% but if I recognize that things have turned against me then I will exit for a much smaller gain. There is no reason to let a play go red… 3% green is better then -20% red. 

Generally I will just add some stop limit orders as you can see and I will continue to increase that level as price moves in my direction. And if it stops me out green well it’s a win either way! Now the issue here is that many many times I stop out way before the actual L2L ever fully plays out. Which means I miss out on a HUGE win, however, if you look at the first stop limits here I was playing the 374.9 support to 378 breakout and got a nice win. I really thought we were going to see a huge green day and very well could have let those run think we see 380-385. However, had I done that on Friday I would have taken a massive loss on that sell off. 

I would say the biggest risk on these L2L plays is that we can not use a hard fast and set stop loss. If we do at say -20% like we usually do then we may stop out before key support actually holds and the play develops. However, when the key support or resistance against us breaks we have to exit and be okay accepting the loss. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vvzvvgcv5dy91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd185965e1d499dd583550d28838e566ef2b9eb8

Here is an example of when I actually followed my own stop loss and had I actually diamond handed it this play the very next candle would have been back to profits. However, we HAVE to be mechanical in trading. We cant be smarter then the candles or the charts. IF the play fails it fails. If it comes back to life after we close it… then that’s something we can consider and something to take into play about perhaps using a looser stop loss next time but in my opinion for every play that came back from the dead there are 10 that never came back. My losers that I have held that never come back GREATLY outweigh those that come back to life. 

Hope this helps clear some things up for you guys!"	0.8	18	0	18	question	2022-11-06T20:14:05Z	ynw6kd	t3

wallstreetbets	advisoryexcellence	self.wallstreetbets	10	Genuine Question About PENN Entertainment Stock	"Regardless of their affiliation with Barstool Sports and the controversy around David Portnoy, why is this stock underperforming in the markets?

**Company overview:**

An American entertainment firm that manages integrated entertainment, sports content, and casino gaming is Penn Entertainment, Inc., formerly known as Penn National Gaming. It runs 43 locations in North America, many of which go by the Hollywood Casino name. In addition, the business holds a 36% share in Barstool Sports. The corporate spin-off of Gaming and Leisure Properties, a real estate investment trust, was accomplished by Penn in 2013.

**Recent activity:**

* *For $2 billion, Penn National and Score Media and Gaming Inc. will be acquired in August 2021. The businesses have been working together strategically since 2019.*
* *At Hollywood Casino Morgantown, Penn National unveiled a career centre in September 2021.*
* *Penn National disclosed a strategic alliance with the Louisiana-based Sports Betting Exchange in February 2022. TheScore's online sports betting platform and app, theScore Bet, began accepting wagers in Canada in April 2022 and was named the Toronto Blue Jays' exclusive betting partner.*
* *The business changed its name to Penn Entertainment in August 2022 to reflect its expansion into sports content and other forms of entertainment. The business declared in the same month that it was acquiring the remaining Barstool shares and assuming complete control.*

**Final words:**

The stock is now trading at US$32.69 (PENN: NASDAQ), but analysts feel it should be closer to US$50 given the company's size, mergers and acquisitions, locations, financials, and growing popularity of gambling in general and online gambling in particular.

What do you think? Is PENN a long game hold, or will it peak at US$35."	0.67	3	0	3	question	2022-11-06T11:21:18Z	ynkjbl	t3

U.S. and Europe have been fairly relaxed with COVID since the vaccine has released. But China has not. Any inkling of covid, and they lock down hard. So much so that workers are not allowed to leave work, quarantine there, and then only leave to go home when the government allows it. 

As a result the largest factory in China has had many workers quit and they plan to not go back. If this continues for more than a month this could lead to a 30% reduction in iPhone sales, which would spell a loss for Apple next quarter. 

Pay attention. With Apple bucking the trend to sell off, they may get hit this week a bit, and be sidelined come next earnings report."	0.71	15	0	15	dd	2022-11-06T10:42:33Z	ynjx72	t3

wallstreetbets	Optimal_Land7816	self.wallstreetbets	15	Most Anticipated Terrorist Attacks for the Week of 11/07 - 11/11	"Hi guys, terrorist attacks are always a black swan event in the markets. Most of us remember the 2015 Paris Attacks, and 2017 Manchester City Attacks. When false rumors about the Holland Tunnel being bombed spread to media, markets also experienced a flash crash with stock prices receding for the day.

The more recent terrorist attacks are listed below, and government officials have increased security going into elections.

&amp;#x200B;

**October 30 2022**

An attack UK immigration center killed no one.

**October 31 2022**

Paul Pelosi was attacked (If the great insider trader is being ambushed, the markets are likely are going to see this as a catalyst for downward price action when another notable terrorist attack manifests itself.)

Al Shabab killed 100 people in Somalia

&amp;#x200B;

Attacks on French African nations never get fair coverage from the media, so the markets did not move on this news. Unfortunately, Western media does give huge coverage to terrorist attacks in Middle Eastern Countries not only because of their ability to strike Europe swiftly. The US also has huge oil interests in the Middle East.

On Monday, Iran will likely begin preparations to release terrorist supercells into Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia has already corroborated on this narrative, and Iran's motive for the  attacks is to distract the world from ongoing protests against the current Iranian leader.

The Manchester Area is also likely to be struck again very soon, as official testimonies from UK officials prove that they have not learned much from their previous experience. The annual Independence riots in Catalan and the annual protests from the Irish backstop against Brexit are also coming up.

The world cup will start 11/20 in Qatar, so that might be another event to pay close attention to.

&amp;#x200B;

I will browse telegram groups and attach more updates about these attacks really soon."	0.56	4	0	4	question	2022-11-06T04:32:17Z	ynd1tx	t3

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%. (Stats as of 2022-10-28)"	0.71	3	0	3	dd	2022-11-08T07:15:33Z	ypaui7	t3

Cathie Wood just unloaded her NVDA shares ahead of Q3 earnings report. 52 week low for NVDA was 108 this year. I guess she expects them to drop significantly and will likely rebuy shares after earnings or wait longer until market crashes. This is a great opportunity to buy puts.

You’re feeling confident that it will be a mild winter, having just voted Liz Truss into parliament, you feel proud to call yourself Briton. Sure, the Christmas ham this year is going to cost 30 to 60% more than a year before, but at least those pesky Germans aren’t holding your country back from achieving its full potential anymore. As you lay to rest by the warmth of your gas-fueled furnace, you drift off, certain that your country’s political woes are in the past. You know Britain’s future is bright. Long live the queen.  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Unfortunately, your fantasy is cut short by the sound of Ukrainian refugees busking for change on the street. You realize, with a sudden sense of dread, the Queen is dead, Liz Truss has resigned from office, and your pension is made up almost entirely of over-leveraged gilt-edged securities. That's right, the Yanks have pulled yet another feather from their caps, and much like the winter of 1776, are crossing the Delaware to deliver a frigid surprise.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

*TL;DR -*  **Britain’s only reward for demolishing the Nord Stream 2 pipeline is higher interest rates and a stronger U.S. Dollar. The European economy is collateral damage for the U.S.’s hegemonic assertion of dominance over its oriental brethren. By sacrificing their pensions and currencies, the plurality of European citizens will allow the greatest nation, the United States, to live another day. We thank you for your service.**

**As failed economic policy gives way to tactical retreat, keep an eye out for ‘friendshoring’ and opportunities to invest in the United State's new strategic industrial allies, like Mexico and Haiti.**

I expect market to drop right after the report is released so just be cautious going into tomorrow rally for midterms. Shouldn’t have to remind everyone that this market being manipulated with current things going on in America. There’s really nothing to be rallying about. Cost of foods is still up energy still up I don’t see any change from last month other than reports of rent not being paid and have rental cost for homes the last 6 months has gone up 20%.

wallstreetbets	DaddyDersch	self.wallstreetbets	20	11-7-22 SPY/ ES Futures, Apple and Tesla Daily Market Analysis	"Hope everyone had a great weekend! Spy put in what I would call a bullish day today and one that is hinting a further upside for tomorrow at least. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pv8feaxfrly91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b0e0f0a54553451549071a444463065cf7f3371

Despite the struggle almost all day for SPY to break through 370 resistance we finally saw spy break through before power hour and end the day extremely bullish. The biggest bullish moves today was confirming the daily 20ema as support, closing over the daily 8ema support and closing back inside the green channel. The next step for bulls is to take our 380 resistance that held us up end of day and close over the 50ema. With the black rising wedge still in tact you can see my next target for SPY is that 388.5 to 390 level which I believe we could see before Wednesday EOD. 

However, tomorrow we have to see SPY break through 380 which is where that red resistance line for the pre fomc/ fomc sell off intersects. Once we break through that then this sell off from CPI is effectively over and we can look for some upside. However, if bears manage to hold us under 380 we could see a potential double top at 380 and look for a closure back under 378 which then would show signs of weakness for Wednesday. 

Support- 378 -&gt; 376.2 -&gt; 374.7 -&gt; 371.4

Resistance- 380 -&gt; 384 -&gt; 388.6

&amp;#x200B;

Futures is holding within the blue rising wedge still also. It’s a little hard to tell but I highlighted in purple that key 3805 level which futures if finally going to close over (this is much like 378 for spy). With this closure it opens us up for the next key level of 3925. 

If 3805 is lost and especially closed under again tomorrow then we will look for a retest of the mid to lower 3700s. 

Key support- 3805 -&gt; 3750 -&gt; 3675

Key resistance- 3865 -&gt; 3925

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r69c3tugrly91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc1041bb2933bdcabaaf0768a85e94e06559ee8c

Apple despite looking extremely weak this morning on more china news managed to pull out a green day with a nice hanging man candle finish and still maintained a closure over 138.1 support. Though Apple barely scrapped by with a green day apple will look to test that steep red bear channel resistance tomorrow. If they can break through 139.9 resistance it should open up some more upside and possibly look to see that 145 gap fill. 

Key support- 138.1 -&gt; 137.1 -&gt; 135

Key resistance- 142.1 -&gt; 145

&amp;#x200B;

And then there was Tesla…. She giveth and she taketh just as fast. I mentioned that pretty massive diamond pattern that hard formed on tesla last week and we officially did break through the support line and now only that we broke all the way through the red sideways channel. I took a pretty big L on my tesla calls (shoulda closed for break even at open) today looking for a recoil off the lows like it has historically done. 

Highlighted by the 4 blue arrows here is the last 4 times a new low was put in. As you can see the following days resulted in pretty impressively green bounces. I am playing some calls for that historical bounce. With a new 52 week low put in and seemingly no catalyst for further dropping I like the odds of a bounce at least beast to reconfirm 205.6 as resistance. However, if we see further sell off tomorrow I will accept my loss on it. The 15min chart is forming a nice 197 double double bottom. 

Key support- 197 -&gt; 193.3 -&gt; 184.3

Key resistance- 201.8 -&gt; 205.6

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zngtnoqirly91.png?width=627&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9b10b3e5e7e7e1faf0e9381751d5f869fc9b603

The VIX seemingly continues to point to more upside to come. Which is actually fairly impressive considering CPI is in 3 days now. I would have expected to at least (though we did at open) see some fear being put back into the markets. However, we actually formed a bearish daily engulfing candle (bearish because its red but for SPY this would be bullish). We also continue to reject the daily 8ema on the VIX. I mentioned last week that premiums are very cheap for longer DTE right now but I believe you are way too early to be going long as the VIX hasn’t hinted at any sort of upside in weeks. Actually what is even more impressive of the last 20 trading days… the VIX has either closed red OR closed &lt;1% green. The fear in this market is gone right now. Which leads to me show this next chart. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dfln1xilrly91.png?width=606&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e379545443901d6c0c50c5a1f720a6322505f6c6

Looking at the fear and greed index… we are actually at the highest level of greed that we have been at since January of 2022. Which for those of you who forgot… from January 4th (about peak of the greed of 65) to January 27th (roughly the bottom of the greed index of 20) SPY fell from 479.98 to 420.76 or fell $59.22 and 12.4%. 

The current FG index reading is 61. The January 4th peak was 65 before it dropped us to a fear of 20. The April peak hit 62 before it finally sold of and dropped us to the May 12th fear level of 3 (wow). August 12ths peak hit 68 before it dropped us to our September 30th low of 15.  

Januarys drop= 12.4% drop over 13 days  
 Aprils drop= 16.7% drop over 32 days  
 Augusts drop= 17.4% drop over 32 days  
   
 

That would mean we COULD be gearing up for roughly a 15.5% drop over the next about 26 days… that would give us roughly a drive target (from todays close) of 321.06 by December 12th…. 

Now hear me out on this one which is even more WILD… December 12th is the next CPI reading (after this Thursday) and then FOMC is on December 13th (the day after)…. Is it possible that we are about to see a top put in this week and this CPI is about to start a slow bleed down to 320 over the next month? Its possible… 

Something to consider for this CPI that is coming up here in 3 days now. I still favor as I said last week a green Monday and Tuesday (half way there) followed by either a green or red Wednesday which would most likely result in a nice inside day. Then Thursday is going to be a huge miss on CPI ( analysis was posted to the server on my trade plan). This huge CPI miss could have the weight to start the next leg down on SPY especially depending on what happens with the mid term elections this week.

Today was my first red day since I believe September 1st. Didn’t miss it by much but red nonetheless. I held my tesla call far too long and should have realized that loss much faster. I also had another break even attempt to exit it this morning and failed to take it… though I wouldn’t have pinned tesla for a new 52 week low today at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

Something important to keep in mind with red days is that we can not let a day be so red that it makes not only the day but the week red. For me despite the bigger loss this week easily will be a green week if I continue to trade well. Another thing that many traders make the mistake of doing is revenge trading. They see that red day and think dang it I really need to get green today let me force this trade or let me do XYZ and they end up turning a manageable red day into a unmanageable red week. 

The best thing to do is start the day fresh. Every day is a new day and every week is a new week… every trade is a new chance… If you had a great win or a huge loss on your last trade, day or week we can not let that sway us or change or mechanics. 

Something I am going to intertwine on my level to level plays is a -25% stop loss on all plays. If they play is done correctly then If it hits that red I was wrong and it wont really come back to life. Trading a longer DTE on these allows for plenty of movement before -25% ever happens. This was the struggle I always had with scalps before I set a mechanical stop loss was that I would marry my play. I don’t want to get in a habit of that with these level to levels even though I know sometimes they need time to mature… this COULD result in a lower win rate as I may stop out more BUT for instance today had I stopped out on my Tesla and SPY level to levels that closed very red I would have ended up very green today. 

Actually had a capped my L2L plays at -25% today for the two losers I would have only closed down -$50 for my L2L plays and with my $1249 from scalps today woulda ended the day up $1199 instead im ending it down about $103. 

Youtube will be up later! 

Hope you guys had a great day."	0.91	29	0	29	dd	2022-11-08T01:10:11Z	yp29ib	t3

How would an investor weigh any company data coming out of such an opaque system? The way I see it, this is an easy short with q2 puts on both now that they've been given some artificial juice from a fake, lockdown easing rumor driven pump. The bull argument, 'they're cheap', doesn't really hold up in a situation where the company becomes a literal extension of the CCP and all that entails combined with China being in such a bad economic state that they delayed their already doctored GDP numbers. So we have Mao 2.0 in complete control of a cratered economy and a lockdown traumatized population. What's the steel man here? What's the counter argument for shorting the shit out of this dumpster fire? While this will be a magnet for the pink legion and their down voting bots, I am genuinely curious about the China bull case for 2023.	0.9	9	0	9	question	2022-11-07T23:01:56Z	yoyih9	t3

AMD is announcing their new server chip on Nov 10th. Their last 3 server chip announcements that I remember have resulting in huge gains for the stock on the day of announcement. I played the last one and made a shit ton of money only to lose it all in the past 12 months. Here is some data: 

Aug 8th 2019: AMD announces ROME epyc CPUs; they destroy Intel in almost every metric. 
**+16% that day**

March 27th 2021: AMD announces Milan CPU. Same story. 
**+6% that day**

Nov 8th 2021: AMD announces Genoa CPU. Blah blah Facebook partnership
**+10% that day**

Nov 10th 2022: AMD will announce new chip. I take a wild guess it will be way better than what Intel has to offer.

wallstreetbets	Meme_Pope	self.wallstreetbets	18	DD: Kanye/Adidas Split Is A Massive Dub For Adidas	"Been seeing a lot of doomer posts about Adidas after splitting with Kanye. As an autistic sneakerhead, I think there are a lot of angles that others aren't seeing, which can turn this into a win for Adidas. 

First Things First:
Adidas owns the rights to almost every Yeezy sneaker and has already stated that they will continue to make them, without paying Kanye. Assuming that Yeezy sales return to normal, this is a big net gain for Adidas, as Kanye's cut is reported to be significantly more than Michael Jordan gets from Jordan Brand. I don't anticipate that the removal of his name will have any impact on the desirability of the shoes. Now on to the opportunities:

Collaborations:
Almost all of Nike's biggest releases are collaborations with other people and companies. Travis Scott, Supreme, Fragment, Sacai. Cool colorways alone aren't enough to sell a shoe people have seen a hundred times, these collaborations keep decades' old sneaker designs fresh. Yeezy has never done a single collab in 7 years with Adidas. Post-Kanye, I expect this to change. Fear of God, one of Nike's biggest collabs, just moved to Adidas, I would not be surprised if they reworked some Yeezy designs. Adidas will no doubt pull others in to help reboot the brand. They will also likely mix it up and integrate Yeezy designs with their own sneakers, whereas Yeezys up until this point have been extremely rigid and reluctant to change and aspect of the shoe other than the color. 

The Double Edged Sword of Kanye's Designs:
Kanye's unconventional style has obviously led to many legendary sneaker designs, but he seems to actively shun what people seem to want at the expense of easy money for Adidas. For years, people clamored for more colorful 350's, while he churned out nothing but increasingly strange earth-toned colorways. The Yeezy 380 is the perfect case study in this behavior: initially very popular upon release, he proceeded to sabatoge the sneaker with one horrifically ugly colorway after another until it was in the clearance bin and cancelled. A more sane management team will be able to chart a course to experement on some releases while raking in the cash on others with more broad appeal. 

Unlock The Vault: 
Yeezy has an untapped back-catalogue of sneakers that resell for ridiculous amounts of money. The Yeezy 750 was massively popular and only received 4 colorways before being inexplicably cancelled forever, this could have been a line of boots to rival Uggs. Adidas recently started re-releasing classic Yeezys without Kanye's permission, leading to an Instagram meltdown. With Kanye out of the picture, I imagine that they ramp this up and continue going back to the well for free money. 


Adidas' stock price is down 66% in the past year. The general sentiment seems to be that the loss of Kanye is a deathknell for the brand, when the reality is quite the opposite. If Adidas plays their cards right, they can benefit massively from a Yeezy Brand free from Kanye and his insanity. They can manage it like an actual clothing brand and not some sort of avante garde fashion-house with a holy mission. This is an opportunity for Adidas and I think it's a good buying opportunity for the stock."	0.54	2	0	2	dd	2022-11-07T19:45:03Z	yosmlr	t3

Second, both us government and commercial sides are growing. I've worked for the government and I can tell you that once they start working with someone they like, they stay with them for a while. The fact pltr is continuing to see big growth in government just proves they're establishing a powerful moat. The commercial side is also growing steadily, and will likely continue to increase as companies look for ways to become more financially efficient.

Third, the company is making money, increasing its cash position, and has zero debt. I know people will whine about gap profitability, but they'll only be able to do so until we do reach gaap profitability, which pltr has been inching closer to each quarter.

Finally, they're one of the few businesses experiencing strong growth in a recession. I know some might look at pltr and say the price dropped too fast. But they had an IPO literally before one of the largest tech bubbles in history.

And just remember, a lot of big gains are made over years. Amazon was trading for the price of a cup of iced coffee after the dot com crash and it exploded. AutoZone was trading for basically $10 in the 90s and was recently hovering around $2k a share. Don't be a doofus. 

Peter Lynch said it best, companies with no debt that are making money won't ever go bankrupt. We're about to head into the heat of a recession where a lot of companies are going to shrink big time and a lot probably won't be here in 2 years. I know pltr is down, but I also know it's one of the best stocks to get in to over the next few months. 

Also, to the VisualMod because I know you're reading this you piece of garbage--I am a bag holder who bought at $8 and this post might be a coping mechanism."	0.52	2	0	2	question	2022-11-07T19:43:08Z	yoskjr	t3

wallstreetbets	WanderSean8	self.wallstreetbets	29	U.S. Midterms Can Affect Stock Market Significantly, Here Are Some Opportunities	"The 2022 midterm elections will take place on Tuesday, November 8. Most people anticipate Republicans to regain control of the House, or both House and Senate, thanks to massive stimulus and 40-year high inflation that happened under Democrats' control. And that will put Democratic President Joe Biden’s future agenda at risk.

 

But for equity investors, political gridlock is favorable because that will prevent material policy changes for the next two years, especially under current market uncertainties. Even regardless of the winner, the period following midterm elections will typically generate positive returns for stock market. 

Stock market had a rough year, with S&amp;P 500 down nearly 21% YTD, however, that's in line with the midterm election year’s theory: S&amp;P 500 has historically underperformed in the year leading up to midterm elections, and then outperformed thereafter. On average, S&amp;P 500 will gain 16.3% in the 12 months after a midterm election, especially true for one- and three-month periods following midterm elections. 

But what can we expect if Republicans sweep Congress, here are the details:

1. Energy stocks (ExxonMobil, Chevron, etc) are favorable if Republican regains control. Biden’s push for green energy and potential windfall tax for energy companies make those giants unwillingly increase oil &amp; gas production. However, if Republicans win, they will veto those acts.

[https://www.ainvest.com/screener/energy-stocks-adtm(adtm-value)-move-upward/](https://www.ainvest.com/screener/energy-stocks-adtm(adtm-value)-move-upward/)

2. Healthcare stocks (pharmaceutical and biotech) will be benefitted. Democrats push hard to lower prescription drug prices, and if Republican wins, related firms can regain the pricing power.

[https://www.ainvest.com/screener/health-care-stocks-adtm(adtm-value)-move-upward/](https://www.ainvest.com/screener/health-care-stocks-adtm(adtm-value)-move-upward/)

3. Defense stocks (Lockheed Martin, Raytheon Technologies, etc) are favorable because GOP is more willing to spend on defense, especially under geopolitical risks the U.S. is facing. 

4. Traditional Auto stocks (Ford, GM) may favorable because GOP will not hurry to push the green energy transition.

5. Cannabis stocks are unfavorable because GOP will likely push federal legalization off the table.

[https://www.ainvest.com/screener/cannabis-stocks/](https://www.ainvest.com/screener/cannabis-stocks/)

6. Infrastructure and clean energy stocks may unfavorable. Those are democrats’ focus, which regarded unnecessary spending by Republicans for now.

However, no matter which party is in charge of Congress, high inflation will not likely be curled in short term because the only solutions are better supply chains and further monetary tightening by Fed."	0.68	14	0	14	dd	2022-11-07T17:38:10Z	yoouq6	t3

* Morgan Stanley on Friday pulled its rating and price target on Carvana.

Shares of Carvana posted their worst day on record Friday after the company missed Wall Street’s top- and bottom-line expectations for the third quarter as the outlook for used cars falls from record demand, pricing and profits during the coronavirus pandemic.

The stock cratered 39% to end the day at $8.76 a share — slightly higher than its worst-ever closing price of $8.72 a share from May 2017. Shares of the online used car retailer have plummeted by 96% this year, after hitting an all-time intraday high of $376.83 per share on Aug. 10, 2021

The stock’s all-time low of $8.14 a share occurred less than a week after it started trading publicly on April 28, 2017. Carvana’s previous worst day of trading was a 26.4% decline on March 18, 2020.

Morgan Stanley on Friday pulled its rating and price target on Carvana. Analyst Adam Jonas cited deterioration in the used car market and a volatile funding environment for the change.

“While the company is continuing to pursue cost cutting actions, we believe a deterioration in the used car market combined with a volatile interest rate/funding environment (bonds trading at 20% yield) add material risk to the outlook, contributing to a wide range of outcomes (positive and negative),” he wrote in a note to investors Friday.

* Berkshire’s operating earnings totaled $7.761 billion in the third quarter, up 20% from year-earlier period.
* The conglomerate spent $1.05 billion in share repurchases, bringing the nine-month total to $5.25 billion.
* The Omaha-based company suffered a $10.1 billion loss on its investments during the third quarter’s market turmoil, however.

Berkshire Hathaway on Saturday posted a solid gain in operating profits during the third quarter despite rising recession fears, while Warren Buffett kept buying back his stock at a modest pace.

The Omaha-based conglomerate’s operating earnings — which encompass profits made from the myriad of businesses owned by the conglomerate like insurance, railroads and utilities — totaled $7.761 billion in the third quarter, up 20% from year-earlier period.

Insurance-investment income came in at $1.408 billion, up from $1.161 billion a year earlier. Earnings from the company’s utilities and energy businesses came in at $1.585 billion, up from $1.496 billion year over year. Insurance underwriting suffered a loss of 962 million, however, while railroad earnings dipped to $1.442 billion from $1.538 billion in 2021.

Berkshire spent $1.05 billion in share repurchases during the quarter, bringing the nine-month total to $5.25 billion. The pace of buyback was in line with the $1 billion purchased in the second quarter. Repurchases were well below CFRA’s expectation as its analyst estimated it would be similar to the $3.2 billion total in the first quarter.

However, Berkshire did post a net loss of $2.69 billion in the third quarter, versus a $10.34 billion gain a year before. The quarterly loss was largely due to a drop in Berkshire’s equity investments amid the market’s rollercoaster ride.

Berkshire suffered a $10.1 billion loss on its investments during the quarter, bringing its 2022 decline to $63.9 billion. The legendary investor told investors again that the amount of investment losses in any given quarter is “usually meaningless.”

Shares of Buffett’s conglomerate have been outperforming the broader market this year, with Class A shares dipping about 4% versus the S&amp;P 500′s 20% decline. The stock dipped 0.6% in the third quarter.

wallstreetbets	predictany007	self.wallstreetbets	7	The election could be a big tailwind for stocks heading into the end of the year	" On an historical basis, “the Sweet Spot of the 4-year cycle is now,” stock market historian Jeff Hirsch from the Stock Trader’s Almanac said in a recent note to clients.

It’s a well-studied phenomenon: The S&amp;P 500 has tended to underperform in the year leading up to midterm elections, and outperformed in the year after midterms, especially in the period immediately after the election.

The average annual return of the S&amp;P 500 in the 12 months before a midterm election since 1962 is 0.3%, “significantly lower than the historical average of 8.1%,” US Bancorp said in a recent note.

That switches after the election. In the 12-month period after a midterm election, the S&amp;P is up an average of 16.3%.

The outperformance was especially notable in the period three months and six months after the election, when the S&amp;P was up 7.3% and 15.1% on average.

Most attribute the reason for underperformance to policy uncertainty — investors do not know which political party will hold a majority in Congress, which resolves after the midterm election.

“The prospects of the end of the uncertainty are like the light at the end of the tunnel,” Hirsch said in an email to me over the weekend.

The potential for Republican control of the House of Representatives and maybe the Senate is sending signals that at the very least higher taxes and more spending are unlikely.

“To the extent that 2022 turns out to be a wave election for Republicans, the bigger the wave, the more impactful we think it will be for US equities in the short term and into next year,” RBC Capital said in a note to clients over the weekend.

Hirsch also noted that the post-election rally was broad-based: Three months after the midterm election, the Dow, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq were all higher on average from 6.4% to 9.2%, going back to 1950. The S&amp;P was higher 88.9% of the time.

Regardless, strong seasonals are not enough to overcome the macro backdrop of aggressive central banks and the prospect of a worldwide economic slowdown.

“We see no compelling reason to add risk despite the possibility of a bit more year-end upside,” Tony Dwyer from Canaccord Genuity said in a note to clients.

Strong seasonals aren’t enough to get Morgan Stanley’s Mike Wilson to change his bearish tone either: “We remain fundamentally bearish with leading indicators showing further deterioration,” he said.

**Fast SPAC Agrees to Merge with Entertainment Firm Falcon’s Beyond**

Combined firm is set to trade on Nasdaq under the FBYD ticker entity will be valued at about $1 billion including debt

By Gillian Tan

July 11, 2022; Updated July 12, 2022

Falcon’s Beyond Global LLC, a company that develops entertainment experiences, agreed to go public through a merger with blank-check firm Fast Acquisition Corp. II.

The transaction values the combined entity at about $1 billion including debt, according to a statement Tuesday, confirming an earlier Bloomberg News report. Falcon’s Beyond shareholders are rolling their equity positions in the company and are expected to own roughly 80% of the combined firm, assuming there are no redemptions. The company is set to trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker FBYD.

Katmandu Collections LLLP has agreed to invest $60 million in the company via a private placement, and the Fast special purpose acquisition company has agreed to forfeit 20% of its founder shares, which will be allocated to private-placement investors and non-redeeming shareholders.

In another effort to minimize redemptions, 50% of all SPAC shares will become convertible preferred equity paying an 8% dividend, which can be converted at $11 or will be mandatorily converted at$14.30. The convertible was Fast’s answer to a slew of private investments in public equity, or PIPEs, priced at discounts to $10, in an effort to provide investors with “true downside protection,” said Doug Jacob, who founded the SPAC.

Falcon’s Beyond volunteered to a valuation reduction partly to give shareholders in the SPAC more exposure to future performance, Executive Chairman Scott Demerau said in an interview.

“We wanted to show we are aligned with public shareholders and are focused on the long-term success of the company,” he said, adding that the firm selected the Fast SPAC because of its management team’s strong understanding of the hospitality and entertainment industries.

Orlando, Florida-based Falcon’s Beyond, led by Demerau and Chief Executive Officer Cecil Magpuri, in November announced a joint venture with Melia Hotels International SA to build and develop a theme park in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic -- which uses characters from animated children’s program “CoComelon” -- with projects in Tenerife, Spain, and Playa Del Carmen, Mexico, to follow. Separately, Falcon’s Beyond has said it’s developing a theme park outside of Saudi Arabia’s capital, Riyadh, with Qiddiya Investment Co.

Falcon’s Beyond also is in talks with New World Development Co.’s K11 to develop experiential locations in Greater China, Magpuri said, adding that the company wants to go head to head with larger rivals, including Walt Disney Co.

The Fast SPAC, affiliated with investment firm &amp;vest, is led by CEO Sandy Beall. It raised $222 million in a March 2021 initial public offering.

Guggenheim Securities LLC advised Falcon’s Beyond on the merger agreement, and Jefferies Financial Group Inc. advised the Fast SPAC."	0.5	0	0	0	question	2022-11-07T15:55:16Z	yom0vm	t3

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you are having a fantastic day. I wasn’t gonna post anything on Sunday but then i realized i have been slacking a lot recently. So today I am gonna bore y’all guys again with another one of my newsletter. It’s highly recommended you read this letter while you’re sober. Now wherever you read it, that’s not my place to say. You can read it in a stripclub or the toilet seat in a bar. I don’t mind at all but what I do mind is you read it, throw it away, forget about it and then later rekt yourself in a trade and then cry about how the market is manipulated and start blaming the people who fed you the narrative be it on Main-Street or Wall Street media. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Remember it’s always advisable to “Do your own research” “This is not financial advice”. So if you rekt yourself it’s your fault not anyone else.*

&amp;#x200B;

So today we are gonna talk about and not only just talk we are gonna visualize the past Santa Claus rally coinciding with the midterms election rally and draw meaningful conclusions from it. This post shall be based on manual interpretation and then finally we are gonna use the analysis what we have drawn to check whether it fits our theory called “The Great Financial Crisis in 99 days” For those who don’t know we released our most anticipated newsletter in a very long while. But unfortunately due to some technical issues with the Turing bot the post cannot be seen on Wsb. So you are advisable to go check my pinned tweet or you can hop on discord to get the letter. It’s completely free of charge but you have to work for it. I’m not gonna share the link here because some of you may find it inappropriate.

&amp;#x200B;

Without any further delay let us begin and dive into the visual analysis. An analysis you might have rarely seen on Wall Street.

\- We have taken into account that post midterms we are gonna crash till March 2023 so we are gonna look for till December end and the next yr end cases. I know it sounds confusing but you will see later on what I mean.

&amp;#x200B;

**Procedure :** 

We will be using the Dow Jones Industrial average since 1896 coz we are the only guys who do every analysis based on the past 120 yr. The vertical will be either in red ( Republicans Presidents ) , blue ( Democratic Presidents )  and gray ( Mid terms elections ). The gray line will have two variables i.e. H suggesting “House” and S suggesting “Senate”. + ve , -ve , = will be seats added, subtracted , or remained the same after election conclusion.

Note : I forgot to remove = later on. So it will be either = +ve or = -ve or = =.

We also have a 4 points table of Santa, Evil Santa giving info about period b/w mid terms and yr end. And then there is Dragon King and Bull Market giving us info about period after mid terms till next yr end.

&amp;#x200B;

**Experiment :**

1. 1896 - 1904 : 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mmztjs8yxiy91.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ed1c1ce2799f71f90c2dc74493d6e36a12f9dd4

Since we know we are not in a bull market so it makes sense to take bear market analysis. As you can see this contradicts our theory and says it’s after Feb first week you start crashing that means Santa Claus rally is coming but you can also see the power was under Republicans and not Democrats.

**Result : Okay fine. Santa 1 , Evil Santa 0 , Dragon King : 1, Bull mkt : 0**   

&amp;#x200B;

2 ) 1904 - 1912 : 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vd19gvs4yiy91.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f96549f294e37e930185102f8d299fe35e8b5b8

Look at these times. I wonder what was going on here that markets decided to for a lost decade. As you can see markets peaked in 1906 and then it was only until 1916 we went for a bull market. But we don’t care about the lost decade right now. All we care about is Santa. So as you can see our first condition i.e. be in a bear market is fulfilled. So we can do an analysis on this and observe with your own eyes that markets fell either -42% in next yr or just stagnated and went -14% by next yr. No Santa Claus rally here.

**Result : Santa 2, Evil Santa 1, Dragon King 3, Bull mkt : 0**

&amp;#x200B;

3) 1912 - 1920

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/koqvhaq8yiy91.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f1efc09817a2c7253227a5458468fcbf0f4afc9

“I hate you i don’t wanna be a bear. I wanna go long with Dems in town” This is the analysis you get after you studying this period. I mean look at that midterms. Even if Biden loses both houses or just one by a -ve seats then the stock market would absolutely rip apart every bear in town. This is the hopium my friend “Tom lee” is smoking. Plus you get the added benefits of being in ⅓ inflationary period of all time. But bears will be like “I wanna exclude the first case because of its bull market”. No we cannot, we were in a bear market but midterms got us out of the bear market. And in the other case, there is no Santa Claus rally but there is a 2023 rally we cannot ignore. Also this election was special because it was the first time since the civil war that Democrats had total control of both houses plus President Wilson became two time serving Democrat since Andrew Jackson in 1828 - 1836.

**Result : Santa 3, Evil Santa 2, Dragon King 3, Bull mkt : 2. And just like that bull mkt scored 2pts in an instant.**

&amp;#x200B;

4) 1920 - 1932

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/avkvw9tdyiy91.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1701543d422083b9791c1fc2406738bef17c9c76

Look guys, I respect both parties and I have to be neutral. So Republican Presidents were you all asleep during 1920-30. Some of the news guys over here on Wsb who do not know their history would be like hey i wanna see how high that chart went up. Respectfully to those people quit trading and investing. So enough bad jokes. Let’s do this analysis. We are gonna exclude this bull market. You all know why by now. As for bear markets it is what it is even though i don’t want to give a single points to Santa rally but i have to give at-least one. As for dragon king in 2023 it clearly deserves 2 pts.

**Result : Santa 4, Evil Santa 3, Dragon King 5, Bull mkt : 2. And just like that bull mkt scored 2pts in an instant.**

&amp;#x200B;

5) 1932 - 1944

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wa080oipyiy91.png?width=1916&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2477219fb481929d0ba78a54f5ffb890dfdc1587

The most loved Democratic President having total control of both houses did not have it easy where clowns at the Federal Reserve were running a freak show over 15 yrs of span. But i guess who can blame them when they had to face world war 2. Btw those who don’t know Ben Bernanke won the Nobel prize for understanding the great depression by making crayon drawings like me. Now since I made bears angry in my President Wilson analysis its time to make some bulls angry by calling the first midterms in the bull market. “No you cannot do that. That’s wrong we were in a bear market of depression” You see for me 1936 is the top that will be broken yrs later in the 1940’s decade. If i start taking the Great depression as peak my god we wouldn’t break even till 1954. So it does not make sense. That leaves us with two markets for midterms. The first one kinda fits our previous newsletter analysis where we do three touches and boom. So evil santa and dragon will receive the points here. As for the other depressing market it’s pretty obvious. Also key thing to note is half of inflationary ⅔ 1940-50 decade midterms was the driving force with Democratic president. I feel sad for Republicans being the most hated but they had it coming by sleeping on the wheels.

**Result : Santa 5, Evil Santa 4, Dragon King 6, Bull mkt : 3. Hmm interesting everyone got a step up.**

&amp;#x200B;

6) 1944 - 1960

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3zxuuwlyyiy91.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b29b9730bf68b5347c6c757a19164240c08ef2c3

This if you remember from last analysis is the second half of ⅔ inflationary period i.e. 1940-1950 high inflation. And then I have also added further mid terms. But to be honest I am just gonna  disregard them completely. I mean look at those raging bull markets in mid terms. I am seriously not gonna take the Post World War 2 boom market of 266% of 86 months into consideration engulfing two midterms and the last midterms coninciding b/w the Cold war bull market. Just not happening here. So that leaves us with this complicated puzzle of 1946-1948. We talked about this extensively in the last newsletter. Just look at the Democratic President stuck in a midterms where he will have -ve seats in both house and senate for sure. So I think even though this analysis is suggesting a Wyckoff accumulation beginning from the post midterms till the entire year 2023 with moves like up +14% then down -12% I believe first a -20% capitulation will come ( highlighted in yellow ) since three touches are complete. Seriously if you do your other macro analysis with your ML and AI algorithms you will always find yourself getting caught in this inflationary decade with high debt/gdp ratio. But since i have to adhere to the principles i constructed hence santa and bull market takes the point. Also no lower lows were formed.

**Result : Santa 6, Evil Santa 4, Dragon King 6, Bull mkt : 4.**

&amp;#x200B;

7) 1960 - 1980

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2f9j03myyiy91.png?width=1918&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28599239b6be9e009eb06448bf0dac01a06e12c8

This is the most interesting mid term analysis I have come across. You can also call this 3/3 inflationary high decade. Anybody out there who calls the current market stagflation should do statistical analysis on this and other charts. It’s a slap on the face of everyone who compares 2022 with 1970’s stagflation. In every post midterms rally the market has already bottomed and it continues to go higher by the following year end. Santa Claus rally came in every single post midterms. I also did the average analysis for you guys coz i love you all so much. The answer is +21.66% by December end. And if you do oil and gold analysis the results are gonna be shocking. Btw for bears who are complaining no you cannot take that one or that one. Sorry guys i have to coz we were falling more than 25% in every two yrs creating multiple bear markets. As for why I took the first one. Did you forget about kick starting the bull markets part?

**Result : Santa 11, Evil Santa 4, Dragon King 6, Bull mkt : 9.**

A freaking 5pt leap by the bull and Santa. Bears bend over now. Tbh guys now you are starting to see why the markets are holding too strong. I think they believe more in the post mid terms rally aka santa claus rally than they believe in Fed pivot. This is what must have caused such bullish returns on post mid terms statistical analysis which is being fed to us in the wall street media.

&amp;#x200B;

8 )  1980 - 1996

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ytt733j6ziy91.png?width=1917&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1248c7966db3df66f30dba953f76e8588a31c8e

Why was I with bears again? Lol. I mean look at those monstrous next year returns. I mean this is what you really call a booming economy. Joe beans i didn’t mean to offend you if you’re reading this. A monstrous 4pt leap again. Hmm i dont think so. Two of those are in the bull market. The 1990 ( kick started the bull mkt ) and 1994 are the only ones in -20% bear market. Now you’re starting to understand guys why the data is statistically favouring the bulls over bears. But I gotta roll with the analysis. Can’t make unnecessary changes. Sorry bears bend over again to bulls in front of these crazy returns.

Average return : +25.62% as opposed to +34.45% taking into account Aug 1987 (Those two overlapped returns )

**Result : Santa 13, Evil Santa 4, Dragon King 6, Bull mkt : 11.**

Now you guys should understand how hard it is to actually be short in the market. Your thesis should be inch precise otherwise you will be caught up in bear hopium and totally forget about riding the bull market.

&amp;#x200B;

9) 1996 - 2012

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3u5o15j6ziy91.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba3daf658f3b40170eb7776ff303a61296b7026c

Finally some slow down. Not your monstrous crazy return now from post midterms to next yr end. So you can clearly see two midterms are in the bull market. Remember this is Dow Jones so maybe for Nasdaq this wont hold true coz Nasdaq peaked in 2000 so it was at bear market in 2008 as well. But yk that in Great depression i cancelled out the high bubble part similarly i might have given a pass to dotcom peak as well. Since we know that we cannot take the bull market part so hence we will take bear market and in that one midterms had santa but other one did not. But still bulls get pts as mkt averaged +ve return yet again for next yr end. No points to dragon king in a long time. 

**Result : Santa 14, Evil Santa 5, Dragon King 6, Bull mkt : 13.**

&amp;#x200B;

10) 2012 - 2022 part 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8jm7dzi6ziy91.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=29567d21788a581824dc125124bdb88858e97dcf

Channeling my inner bear : 

Market should fall by -89% in all indices. Seriously, I had enough. We had globalization because of Reganomics. Hence the market should go to Regan levels. I am just kidding guys. I thought I might find something useful by doing this analysis but instead I found hopium here. It’s hard to be a bear and if anyone on the Internet professes “it’s so easy to be bearish”  “ohh the market will fall -20% for sure” Tell these guys to show them their calculation otherwise everything is priced in. And if these guys cannot show their calculation they really don’t know anything about markets and hence i call them “Born out of dotcom bubble investors”

Oh i totally forgot gotta do these stupid analysis. So as you can see we have never been in a bear market coz we didnt went -20% in Dow Jones. We broke 2008 all time high just after my favorite president of the US got reelected. This 2022 perhaps will be in a long time where we fell more than -20% in Dow indices.

**Result : Santa 14, Evil Santa 5, Dragon King 6, Bull mkt : 13. No points added.**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion :**

As you can see Santa Claus rally is coming and we will have bull market returns by next yr end from current levels i.e. markets will be higher than $3700 SPX by December 31, 2023. Tbh i don’t believe in this but this was the analysis.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Final Result :**

Just long guys. F these bears. They don’t know anything. Powell will pivot in December fomc 2022 -&gt; market will rip higher with 50bps till when powell keeps rate flat or starts cutting. Disinflation trade will come soon. Cpi makes LL stock mkt will make HH &amp; HL. Tbh i dont believe in this but this was the analysis result. I am not joining the Tom Lee camp period. You guys can join him. And if youre thinking of joining me, well think again about this analysis coz me and “Michael Burry “ will march to hell and has a probability of (6/19)\* 100% of winning. I think I have forgotten how to calculate probability.

&amp;#x200B;

Btw i totally forgot to solve

Q. Where are we in regards to this Mid terms X Santa X 2023?

Ans. Well for that. Lets take our first initial condition i.e. a bear market. Second condition would be a Democrats and third condition will be high inflation. These all high inflationary bear markets say we have bottomed and the only move is to the upside till end of yr 2023.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

***Final Thoughts***

Some of you might question if this guy is even human. Who does this kind of analysis rather just write some Python + ML code and then just extrapolate the data. You see guys first of all yes i am human but the thing is I haven’t talked to people like in ages. I just sit in my room and either talk to you or I am just watching an anime, tv show, movie, sports from all across the globe. In short you can say I don’t have a life. My souls are scattered over the Internet and soon it will be on Metaverse. Hence i am bullish on Meta i guess. I am also an old fashioned investor like Gann and Wyckoff who loves crayon drawings over the stock market. I can write code since I was a developer  but I like manual and visual calculations over coding. That goes for my technical analysis as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Enjoy your weekend guys. I hope you guys live your lives to the fullest.

Stay safe! Eat healthy and just keep having discussions with your friends and family.

**That’s all I have to say right now.**

***With lots of love***

**Thank you**

wallstreetbets	Flimsy-Willow-3086	self.wallstreetbets	51	My Full Plan for this Week 11/07 + Challenge Update (3 Watchlist Plays + 6 Earnings Plays, 1 MAJOR Economic Event (CPI))	"Hello ladies and gentlemen

I'm ash and write detailed DD on stocks and events, so last week I published my Full plan and analysis.  
In this post, we will cover

* This week’s Earnings
* This Week's Major Economic Events
* This week’s Watchlist
* This Week’s lotto 10 bagger Play

Ok so let's get this show on the road

We  absolutely crushed it! So missed $TWLO that was a bad play, $TSLA never  ran to $250 but some profit was made there, if you got out early (i  didnt). And $NFLX &amp; $PIN never triggered, so no play.

But earnings plays $CVNA $SQ $ROKU $ETSY $AMD (everyone thought this wouldnt run) $MRNA all were home runs.

Economic  events FOMC meeting went as planned too everyone said 75bps would sell  off, but it ran as expected, then we played the Speech as went along.

Watchlist, $DB, $SPY also played out as expected, so all in all good week!

**Friday 11/11**

11:00 AM Michigan Consumer Sentiment

Obviously  all these are important, but the only one we would be interested in  playing would be the CPI day. You can play CPI day 2 ways

**Option 1:**

Wait  for the results, after the initial drop or jump, the day usually  follows the same direction, you dont have to guess, and you would make  the ALOT of $$ by waiting it out and picking direction after that. If  you play same day options, chop might kill your plays anyway. This is  definetly not a bad option, and the drop or spike really does go on for  the rest of the day, if you check the previous reports thats always the  case.

**Option 2:**  
Speculate,  so Analysts' estimates are for a y/y Oct. CPI of 7.9%, and Cleveland  Fed estimates a y/y CPI of 8.1%. Analysts are either being overtly  bullish, or they something we dont. 60% of issues with last CPI were  supply side driven, while 28% was demand driven as per the Moody’s chart  below.

https://preview.redd.it/b8552gn2oiy91.png?width=596&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03b676ffdd74a81dae13cd57e5e2fab4719c7c0d

So  the question we ask ourselves is, have any of those come down in the  last month? The war Ukraine is still ongoing, so thats not changing.  COVID impact has a subsided a little so we can expect some but not alot  of improvements there. The housing shortage might even be worse, with  the high interest rates, people may not be able to afford houses even if  sellers decrease prices as they afraid to lock in a high rate (as they  should be)

So that leaves us with  the demand side, which is what the Fed’s have been working on. We can  expect as rates are higher, to see better numbers when it comes things  that are loans depended, so we can see a weakening in Automative  pricing/demand ( A look through FB sales groups and twitter car  ‘’influncers’’ would suggest that this is indeed happening) Same goes  for most consumer durables based on my research through sales groups and  experts. This is to be taken with a grain of salt offcourse as i dont  have access to Big Data like the analysts do, but it does explain why  they might be expecting a big reduction in CPI.

The  Last time we were below 8.1% was Feb 2022, if we go below 8 i expect a  bull run like no other, as its almost a certainty that we dont 75bps  anymore and Fed will definitely soften their approach. Combine that with  mid elections a typically bullish time. And lots of cash on the  sidelines, the run will be glorious if that happens. I will be siding  with the analysts on this one, and taking a small calls position before  market opens $SPX. And will leave plenty of cash in case im wrong, and  it goes the other way around.  
Remember CPI day is one of those days where you can make alot of money without risking too much. So play accordingly.

# Watchlist

**- $TSLA Long**  
Looks  like the market might be bullish till CPI, $TSLA Held $203.84 Support  as long this line holds, first TP for me will be $216.8 and then $224

https://preview.redd.it/zygiyx04oiy91.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77f7b5237249743b8c64a758d80e5f329030e65e

**- $AMD Long/Short**  
Has  not been able to break throught the $62.7 level since earnings, pretty  much in a channel now, if it breaks resistance will go long, if it cant  will short till next support at $60

https://preview.redd.it/p0gb25n4oiy91.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d05e6b5ae9e4dfc0b496c9e6fbb5b2a848593300

**- $VIX Long**

Lot  of chatter lately about VIX big spike coming soon, while i personally  dont see it, the trend lines we drew 4 month ago, remain respected so my  play here, is if we break and hold $25.6 resistance ill take calls, if  that fails we are likely going back to retest the trend and likely break  it all the to $22 at which point i would take profits

https://preview.redd.it/dh5dkad5oiy91.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0109cc262fee83a420316fcd9e9af8b9f522feb

# Bonus Potential 10 Bagger Play

Im  not going to add something just to have a play, i couldn’t find  anything, SPX will for sure be 10X play on CPI day, but beyond that i  got nothing this week. But i will 100% find a good for next week.

Alright,  so that's it for this week, ill be doing this every week and going  through the previous week’s play to see how much we gained and where we  went wrong.

If you have any questions let me know, none of this is financial advice

Historically DAL has traded at a PE of 9 times.  That would put the stock price back in the 60s.  In 2019, Revenue was 73/share with 643 million shares outstanding ($47 billion).  Profit was $7.31/share.  Stock price range in 2019 was 45-63.  For much of 2021 (pandemic) the stock was in the mid 40s.

The last quarter the company did $14 billion in operating revenue.  Annualized, that is roughly $50-56 billion in revenue for the year.  Realize this is while operating in the low 80% capacity."	1.0	2	0	2	question	2022-11-08T08:02:41Z	ypbrjb	t3

wallstreetbets	Optimal_Land7816	self.wallstreetbets	2	Update on Zendesk	"I have visited Delaware's Division of Incorporation and paid 20 dollars to see whether Zendesk has filed for the Certificate of Merger or the Certificate of Consolidation.

The company is still in ""Good Standing"" as of Monday afternoon. I was also able to confirm that Zendesk's most recent filing was in May 01 2018 related to Zendesk's buyout of software company FutureSimple. That filing was 4 months ahead of Zendesk publicly announcing the acquisition.

Because Zendesk is being acquired by a private equity firm, the timeline is much shorter. The merger or consolidation filing will be made two days before announcement of the deal's completion.

Filings with the state for Highly anticipated M&amp;A deals also tend to happen on Tuesday nights. I will come back on Tuesday night (in a few hours) with another updated report on the company's most recent filings with Delaware's Division of Corporation.

If Zendesk has not made any filings by then, the chances of the buyout being completed by the end of the week will be very low. If they do make the filing by Tuesday night, you have until Wednesday market close to load the boat with 77 dollar call options, or until Thursday market close if they choose to wait until Thursday afterhours to publish the press release.

Once again, Zendesk is being acquired by London boutique investment firm Hellman and Friedman for 77.5 per share.

wallstreetbets	Massive_Release_6110	self.wallstreetbets	9	LET'S TRY TO ANTICIPATE THE INFLATION DATA	" This is the week of inflation data. 

Let's try to anticipate what will come out of the official data. 

The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland provides daily “nowcasts” of inflation for two popular price indexes, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the consumer price index (CPI). Nowcasts are estimates or forecasts of the present. 

The Cleveland Fed produces nowcasts of the current period's rate of inflation — inflation in a given month or quarter — before the official CPI or PCE inflation data are released. These forecasts can help to give a sense of where inflation is now and where it is likely to be in the future. As with any forecast, there is no guarantee that these inflation nowcasts will be accurate all of the time.

 But historically, the Cleveland Fed’s model nowcasts have done quite well — in many cases, they have been more accurate than common benchmarks from alternative statistical models and even consensus inflation nowcasts from surveys of professional forecasters.  

The forecasts updated to November 4th show that inflation is still very high. Higher than expectations: the total inflation according to these data is still at 8.06% against the expected 8% while the core inflation (excluding food and energy) is at 6.58% against the expected 6.5%. Markets are unlikely to take this news well if it becomes official.

I hear many people here saying they’re not going to buy a Tesla because of Elon. You’re not alone. There are millions of progressives around the country who won’t want to either.

What I am curious about is what happens if Tesla becomes the only US EV you can buy (1) with the full subsidy (2) within a reasonable timeframe. Yes, others like the Bolt with ultium will have the subsidy too, but it’s highly likely that they won’t be able to meet demand…..

So what happens? Dealerships become thieves. Salesmen hint that $1000 puts you on the waitlist for this year—otherwise wait till 2024! Dealerships put on thousand of dollars of mandatory upgrades. Dealerships have a MSRP adjustment. And the price won’t be guaranteed on delivery. You go to buy one of the few non tesla full subsidy EVs and suddenly you’re facing thousands of dollars of fees.

I am truly, honest before the gods, sympathetic to people who are annoyed with Elon rn. I am too. But how much of a premium are these feelings worth? It is almost a guarantee that by the time the ^ situation I spelled out above plays out, (1) a standard 4680 model Y will have a $ per mile of range as cheap, or cheaper, than competition because it will receive the full IRA subsidy. 

I know everyone here is aware of the shitty state of the non tesla charging network. These stories will grow. I have a friend who bought the id4 that won’t road trip with it anymore. They are not alone. 

So hate Elon all you want. I don’t blame you. But let’s be honest… the tesla cost advantage is going to grow, and unless legacy seriously reforms the dealership system and third party charging reliability goes up significantly…then the cost of avoiding tesla for an EV *in the future* goes up a lot."	0.43	0	0	0	question	2022-11-08T16:09:57Z	yplqz6	t3

wallstreetbets	InvestingOpinions	self.wallstreetbets	19	How low can the S&amp;P go?	"The S&amp;P, currently at 3800, has a P/E ratio of around 19 and a half, down from the 30+ it was last year. If we revert to the mean of 15 in terms of PE, we’re looking at a 25% drop from here which takes us to 2850. The scenario of complete reversion to the mean is tied to 30 year treasury yield to revert to its long term average of 6.29%, which seems unlikely unless inflation expectations really get out of control.
So let’s say this is the worst case scenario. 

Then we have earnings contraction, latest estimates by Goldman are around 11% in the next 2 years.
That would take us from 2850 to 2536.

Would you consider 2500 a good approximation for a worst case scenario, in which earnings come down and inflation is not tamed?

I am wondering when to enter this market in a major way, and 3200 seems like a good point to start averaging down. In my mind, if the worst case is to 2500, it is a 22% decline from 3200, very bearable psichologically. 
My investment time horizon is 20+ years, so not too worried about the incoming recession. Not trying to pick the bottom, just curious about how bad shit can get."	0.91	9	0	9	question	2022-11-08T15:27:15Z	ypkotp	t3
